    "title": "GpJSON: High-performance JSON Data Processing on GPUs",
    "abstract": "The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format is ubiquitous, and countless applications depend on it to store and exchange high volumes of data. Despite its great popularity, JSON is nevertheless a very inefficient data format: decoding and querying JSON data is often a major bottleneck for many data-intensive applications. \nIn this paper, we explore how Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can be used to parallelize  both  JSON de-serialization and querying. We show how JSON parsing can be implemented on GPUs by means of parallel structural index construction, and we describe how JSON data can then be queried  in situ  using a lightweight query engine designed to run on GPUs. We present the design and implementation of GpJSON, a GPU-based JSON data processing library. The library can be used from high-level languages such as JavaScript or Python, and features bindings for the GraalVM language runtime. Our evaluation on real-world datasets shows that, on a single NVIDIA Ampere A100, GpJSON achieves at least 2.9× speedup on end-to-end performance (de-serialization plus querying) over state-of-the-art parallel JSON parsers and query engines, and 6-8× over NVIDIA RAPIDS.",

    "title": "ELEET: Efficient Learned Query Execution over Text and Tables",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present ELEET, a novel execution engine that allows one to seamlessly query and process text as a first-class citizen along with tables. To enable such a seamless integration of text and tables, ELEET leverages learned multi-modal operators (MMOps) such as joins and unions that seamlessly combine structured with unstructured textual data. While large language models (LLM) such as GPT-4 are interesting candidates to enable such learned multimodal operations, we deliberately do not follow this trend to enable MMOps, since it would result in high overhead at query runtime. Instead, to enable MMOps, ELEET comes with a more efficient small language model (SLM) that is targeted to extract structured data from text. Thanks to our novel architecture and pre-training procedure, the ELEET-model enables high-accuracy extraction with low overheads. In our evaluation, we compare query execution based on ELEET to baselines leveraging LLMs such as GPT-4 and show that ELEET can speed up multi-modal queries over tables and text by up to 575× without sacrificing accuracy.",

    "title": "Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning",
    "abstract": "Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. \nIn this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least  240 x and  2 . 16 x, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Subsequence anomaly detection for time series is a crucial problem in various real-world applications. However, existing methods proposed so far design the anomaly score functions solely based on either local neighborhood or global patterns, leading to unsatisfactory detection accuracy. In addition, these methods either cannot adapt, or yield insufficient accuracy and efficiency in streaming scenario. Therefore, we propose  Sirloin , an accurate and efficient streaming time series subsequence anomaly detection framework. First,  Sirloin  proposes a glance and focus anomaly score function that takes both global and local information into consideration, contributing to an accurate anomaly detection. Second, Sirloin dynamically maintains an inverted file index and product quantization codebooks to index and compress the subsequences, hence is able to cope with the time series evolution and to process streaming batches efficiently. In addition, a dual index optimization strategy is put forward that further improves the efficiency. An experimental study in 11 different datasets from 5 domains offers insight into the performance of  Sirloin , showing that it improves throughput on average 4 ×  and enhances accuracy 58.02% compared to the state-of-the-art streaming method.",

    "abstract": "Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem in graph analytics with broad applications, yet remains computationally intractable due to its #P-hardness. To address this, numerous approximate solutions have been proposed, though they often suffer from limited efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce  FlowSC , a novel approach that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency in subgraph counting. Our method starts with an enhanced candidate filtering algorithm, which significantly improves the pruning capability of bipartite graph-based techniques with minimal overhead. Building on this, we propose a bottom-up flow-learning model based on a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. By employing a carefully designed message-passing mechanism, the model explicitly controls the direction, range, and iterations of information flow, enabling a simulation of the candidate tree-based counting process. This mechanism is further empowered by a customized message aggregation technique, alongside a pretraining strategy that facilitates model training. Extensive experiments show that  FlowSC  can achieve up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and 3 ×  improvement in efficiency over the baselines across datasets, while scaling to billion-edge graphs.",

    "abstract": "Index tuning is a time-consuming process. One major performance bottleneck in existing index tuning systems is the large amount of “what-if” query optimizer calls that estimate the cost of a given pair of query and index configuration without materializing the indexes. There has been recent work on budget-aware index tuning that limits the amount of what-if calls allowed in index tuning. Existing budget-aware index tuning algorithms, however, typically make fast progress early on in terms of the best configuration found but slow down when more and more what-if calls are allocated. This observation of “diminishing return” on index quality leads us to introduce early stopping for budget-aware index tuning, where user specifies a threshold on the tolerable loss of index quality and we stop index tuning if the projected loss with the remaining budget is below the threshold. We further propose Esc, a low-overhead early-stopping checker that realizes this new functionality. Experi- mental evaluation on top of both industrial benchmarks and real customer workloads demonstrates that Esc can significantly reduce the number of what-if calls made during budget-aware index tun- ing while incurring little or zero improvement loss and little extra computational overhead compared to the overall index tuning time.",

    "abstract": "Processing long-running read-write transactions on graphs is an open challenge, primarily due to the need for serializability to maintain basic structural consistency of graphs. We identify that a fundamental impediment to a solution arises from the homogeneous database-wide notion of transaction isolation developed for relations, which fails to capture the heterogeneous consistency semantics on graphs. We propose Ddi, a notion of ﬁne-grained isolation for graph transactions that advocates per-operation isolation allocation. It extracts concurrency for graph transactions that traditional isolation cannot, by assigning one or multiple isolation levels to each traversal operation, while maintaining graph consistency as serializability does. We develop formal semantics for Ddi and prove the consistency guarantees of its transaction schedules. We also develop  DD-OCC , an optimistic concurrency control protocol for Ddi isolation, and implement it on a state-of-the-art graph storage. Experiments over LDBC graphs conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of Ddi.",

    "abstract": "Isolation bugs, stemming especially from design-level defects, have been repeatedly found in carefully designed and extensively tested production databases over decades. In parallel, various frameworks for modeling database transactions and reasoning about their iso- lation guarantees have been developed. What is missing however is a mathematically rigorous and systematic framework with tool support for formally verifying a wide range of such guarantees for all possible system behaviors. We present the first such framework, VerIso, developed within the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. To showcase its use in verification, we model the strict two-phase lock- ing concurrency control protocol and verify that it provides strict serializability isolation guarantee. Moreover, we show how VerIso helps identify isolation bugs during protocol design. We derive new counterexamples for the TAPIR protocol from failed attempts to prove its claimed strict serializability. In particular, we show that it violates a much weaker isolation level, namely, atomic visibility.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research on time-series anomaly detection, the eﬀectiveness of existing anomaly detectors remains constrained to speciﬁc domains - a model that performs well on one dataset may fail on another. Consequently, developing  automated  solutions for anomaly detection remains a pressing challenge. However, the AutoML community has predominantly focused on supervised learning solutions, which are impractical for anomaly detection due to the lack of labeled data and the absence of a well-deﬁned objective function for model evaluation. While recent studies have evaluated standalone anomaly detectors, no study has ever evaluated automated solutions for selecting or generating scores in an automated manner. In this study, we (i) provide a systematic review and taxonomy of automated solutions for time-series anomaly detection, categorizing them into selection, ensembling, and generation methods; (ii) introduce TSB-AutoAD, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing 20 standalone methods and 70 variants; and (iii) conduct the most extensive evaluation in this area to date. Our benchmark includes state-of-the-art methods across all three categories, evaluated on TSB-AD, a recently curated heterogeneous testbed from nine domains. Our ﬁndings reveal a signiﬁcant gap, where over half of the existing solutions do not statistically outperform a simple random choice. Foundation models that claim to oﬀer generalized, one-size-ﬁts-all solutions have yet to deliver on this promise. While naive ensembling achieves high accuracy, it comes at a substantial computational overhead. Conversely, methods leveraging historical datasets enable fast inference but suﬀer under out-of-distribution conditions. To address this trade-oﬀ, we propose a selective ensembling solution, which combines model selection with ensembling to oﬀer a lightweight, practical balance between accuracy and eﬃciency. We open-source TSB-AutoAD and highlight the need for more robust and eﬃcient solutions.",

    "title": "Effective and Efficient Attributed Hypergraph Embedding on Nodes and Hyperedges",
    "abstract": "An attributed hypergraph comprises nodes with attributes and hyperedges that connect varying numbers of nodes.  Attributed hypergraph node and hyperedge embedding  (AHNEE) maps nodes and hyperedges to compact vectors for use in important tasks such as node classification, hyperedge link prediction, and hyperedge classification. Generating high-quality embeddings is challenging due to the complexity of attributed hypergraphs and the need to embed both nodes and hyperedges, especially in large-scale data. Existing solutions often fall short by focusing only on nodes or lacking native support for attributed hypergraphs, leading to inferior quality, and struggle with scalability on large attributed hypergraphs. \nWe propose  SAHE , an efficient and effective approach that unifies node and hyperedge embeddings for AHNEE computation, advancing the state of the art via comprehensive embedding formulations and algorithmic designs. First, we introduce two higher-order similarity measures, HMS-N and HMS-E, to capture similarities between node pairs and hyperedge pairs, respectively. These measures consider multi-hop connections and global topology within an extended hypergraph that incorporates attribute-based hyperedges. SAHE  formulates the AHNEE objective to jointly preserve all-pair HMS-N and HMS-E similarities. Direct optimization is computationally expensive, so we analyze and unify core approximations of allpair HMS-N and HMS-E to solve them simultaneously. To enhance efficiency, we design several non-trivial optimizations that avoid iteratively materializing large dense matrices while maintaining high-quality results. Extensive experiments on diverse attributed hypergraphs and 3 downstream tasks, compared against 11 baselines, show that  SAHE  consistently outperforms existing methods in embedding quality and is up to orders of magnitude faster.",

    "abstract": "Query optimizers in RDBMSs search for execution plans expected to be optimal for given queries. They use parameter estimates, often inaccurate, and make assumptions that may not hold in practice.

Using ML to improve data systems has shown promising results for query optimization. Inspired by this, we propose   Ro bust   Q uery Optimizer, (Roq), a holistic framework based on a risk-aware learning approach. Roq includes a novel formalization of the notion of robustness in the context of query optimization and a principled approach for its quantification and measurement based on approximate probabilistic ML. It also includes novel strategies and algorithms for query plan evaluation and selection. Roq includes a novel learned cost model that is designed to predict the cost of query execution and the associated risks and performs query optimization accordingly. We demonstrate that Roq provides significant improvements in robust query optimization compared with the state-of-the-art.",

    "title": "OpenMEL: Unsupervised Multimodal Entity Linking Using Noise-Free Expanded Queries and Global Coherence",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL), which involves disambiguating a mention composed of multimodal inputs to a multimodal knowledge base (KB), has gained increasing attention. Although existing MEL approaches using supervised learning show promising performance, they depend heavily on large-scale labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain for each new scenario. Unsupervised learning MEL methods, on the other hand, typically consist of two main steps. In the first multimodal data encoding step, these methods either assume that the multimodal data inputs are of high quality or attempt to filter out the noisy modality. In the second entity ranking step, they employ a bipartite graph to model the relationships only between mentions and entities. However, unsupervised methods face challenges in both steps. In the first step, data quality issues arise, including limited context in textual inputs and noise in the corresponding images. Moreover, in the second step, the bipartite graph fails to capture coherence between highly correlated entities within the KB, which offers clues on shared domains among entities. This limitation hinders effective retrieval of the target entity. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework, OpenMEL, for solving the MEL task. We enhance the textual modality contextual information by incorporating full context comprehension and general knowledge, and generates three levels of visual inputs for further adaptive selection to handle noise. To capture global entity coherence, we construct a tree cover structure, defining it as a maximum spanning tree with bounded nodes to meet the MEL objective. We then introduce a greedy algorithm with theoretical guarantees to solve this problem. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets show that OpenMEL outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "title": "QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-Preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression",
    "abstract": "Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientiﬁc domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientiﬁc data. However, general error-bounded lossy compressors may fail to meet additional quality requirements for downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs). This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientiﬁc discoveries, signiﬁcantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoIpreserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most diﬀerentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) signiﬁcant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six realworld datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-theart error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientiﬁc compressors.",

    "title": "SPECIAL: Synopsis Assisted Secure Collaborative Analytics",
    "abstract": "Secure collaborative analytics (SCA) enables the processing of analytical SQL queries across data from multiple owners, even when direct data sharing is not possible. While traditional SCA provides strong privacy through data-oblivious methods, the signiﬁcant overhead has limited its practical use. Recent SCA variants that allow controlled leakages under diﬀerential privacy (DP) strike balance between privacy and eﬃciency but still face challenges like unbounded privacy loss, costly execution plan, and lossy processing. \nTo address these challenges, we introduce SPECIAL, the ﬁrst SCA system that simultaneously ensures bounded privacy loss, advanced query planning, and lossless processing. SPECIAL employs a novel  synopsis-assisted secure processing model , where a one-time privacy cost is used to generate private synopses from owner data. These synopses enable SPECIAL to estimate compaction sizes for secure operations (e.g., ﬁlter, join) and index encrypted data without additional privacy loss. These estimates and indexes can be prepared before runtime, enabling eﬃcient query planning and accurate cost estimations. By leveraging one-sided noise mechanisms and private upper bound techniques, SPECIAL guarantees lossless processing for complex queries (e.g., multi-join). Our comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that SPECIAL outperforms state-of-the-art SCAs, with up to 80 ×  faster query times, 900 × smaller memory usage for complex queries, and up to 89 ×  reduced privacy loss in continual processing",

    "abstract": "Vector search is widely employed in recommendation systems, search engines, etc. With the explosive growth of online data and streaming processing engines, streaming vector search has attracted increasing research attention. However, prevailing vector search systems like Vearch, Vespa, and Milvus typically operate as external batch services for streaming processing requirements, resulting in sub-optimal performance for streaming processing scenarios. \nIn this paper, we propose VStream, a distributed streaming vector search system. Implementing such a system is non-trivial, raising three technical challenges in streaming adaptability, system scalability, and real-time response. Specifically, VStream offers a dynamic partitioner that adapts to data distribution changes in vector streams. Additionally, VStream features an effective hierarchical storage architecture facilitated by streaming state management, enabling a hybrid of four-level storage media with diverse access speeds and targets. Furthermore, VStream utilizes dynamic hot-cold patterns, such as access frequency, in the streaming vector data, incorporating a specialized hot-cold separation mechanism to enhance query efficiency. Extensive experiments prove that VStream outperforms existing vector search systems, e.g., achieving 251– 373 ×  improvements in query efficiency, 2.2–2.5 ×  savings in CPU usage, and 1.5–2.0 ×  reductions in memory overhead.",

Specifically, we first analyze the relation of the graph partitions, index performance, and parallelism to identify the most suitable partition scheme for G2H, with a hybrid scheme and optimized node ordering for faster contraction. Then, we propose a label-pruning method to reduce the label construction workload with several strategies designed to balance and improve the parallel label construction. Finally, experiments on real-life networks show that our G2H can finish construction within seconds for large urban networks and under one minute for large region networks with 6M vertices, which is several times faster than the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, G2H can answer hundreds of millions of queries per second, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration. KEYWORDS Shortest Distance, Tree Decomposition, GPU, Road Network",

    "abstract": "Developing a code-generating Database Management System requires tight proﬁling and performance-tuning iterations. However, existing proﬁlers report results at instruction or function level, making it challenging to correlate them with constructs like query plan operators to derive actionable insights. \nIn this demonstration, we show how to solve this issue, building on our previous work, Tailored Proﬁling. We introduce UmbraPerf, a novel proﬁling tool that combines proﬁling samples with metadata to map proﬁling results to a DBMS’s internal abstractions, from query plan components down to generated code. Its interactive frontend visualizes data across multiple abstraction levels, enabling developers to narrow performance bottlenecks from operators down to individual instructions. We demonstrate its utility through two scenarios using our publicly available frontend.",

    "title": "MLN-geeWhiz: A Dashboard for Supporting Complete Life-Cycle of Complex Data Analysis using Multilayer Networks",
    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, simple graphs have been extensively used for studying complex systems of interacting entities from diverse disciplines, such as social networks, transportation, epidemiology, etc. However, when studying data with multiple types of entities, relationships, and features, simple (or even attributed) graphs are not always suﬃcient. For example, to study accident patterns to take mitigating actions, one needs to explore accident patterns based on factors like weather (rain, sunny, sleet, etc.), light, and road surface conditions in diﬀerent geographical regions. As another example, to ﬁnd individuals who are inﬂuential across multiple social media, a single graph approach is not well-suited. Indeed, to model such multiple relationships, multiple related graphs are useful. This can be done using multilayer networks (MLNs). \nAny complex data analysis can immensely beneﬁt from interactive graphic tools rather than working with raw data in command prompt mode. This is especially true as data and models become increasingly complex. To interpret and understand the results of analysis, drill-down, and visualization become critical. The MLNDashboard (called  MLN-geeWhiz ) presented in this demo paper aims to facilitate all aspects of MLN layer generation, analysis, and visualization through an intuitive, interactive web-based dashboard. In this paper, we discuss the dashboard, its architecture, the functionality currently supported, and some use cases.",

    "abstract": "Achieving the serializable isolation level is costly. Recent studies have revealed that adjusting specific query patterns within the workload can still achieve serializability, even at lower isolation levels. Nevertheless, these studies typically overlook the trade-off between the performance advantages of lower isolation levels and the overhead required to maintain serializability, potentially leading to suboptimal isolation level choices that fail to maximize performance. In this paper, we present TxnSails, a middle-tier solution designed to achieve serializable scheduling with self-adaptive isolation level selection. First, TxnSails incorporates a unified concurrency control algorithm that achieves serializability at lower isolation levels with minimal overhead. Second, TxnSails employs a deep learning method to characterize the trade-off between the performance benefits and overhead associated with lower isolation levels, thus predicting the optimal isolation level. Finally, TxnSails implements a cross-isolation validation mechanism to ensure serializability during real-time isolation level transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TxnSails outperforms existing solutions by up to 26.7 ×  and PostgreSQL ’s serializable isolation level by up to 4.8 × .",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have recently led to renewed attention towards approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector databases (VectorDB). Among various ANN methodologies, vector quantization techniques like product quantization (PQ) are widely used to generate space-efficient representations for large-scale dense vectors. However, the codebooks generated by PQ often reach several gigabytes in size, making them impractical for web-scale, high-dimensional vectors in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices. \nIn this study, we propose  SegPQ , a simple yet effective framework for losslessly compressing codebooks generated by  any  PQ variants, enabling efficient  in-memory  vector search on devices with limited memory. SegPQ represents the raw PQ codewords as a trained error-bounded piecewise linear approximation model ( 𝜖 PLA) and pre-computed low-bit residuals. We theoretically demonstrate that, with high probability, the number of bits per compressed codeword is 1 . 721  + ⌈ log 2  𝜖 OPT ⌉ , where  𝜖 OPT   is the optimal error parameter that can be determined by data characteristics. To accelerate query execution, we further design SIMD-aware query processing algorithms on compressed codebooks to fully exploit the hardware parallelism offered by modern architectures. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets showcase that, for  1 billion  vectors, SegPQ reduces PQ codebook memory consumption by up to  4.7×  (approx.  851 MB ) while incurring only  3.3% additional query processing overhead caused by decompression.",

    "abstract": "Many modern applications require real-time analytics, where analytical processing (AP) workloads needs access to the latest data updates from a transactional processing (TP) engine. However, managing separate TP and AP engines across teams complicates achieving real-time analytics without switching to specialized HTAP systems. To address this challenge, we introduce  oﬀ-the-shelf real-time analytics , a system design that leverages the existing TP and AP engines to provide (1) the latest transactional updates for analytical queries and (2) support for eﬃcient  transactional analytics –transactions that combine transactional logic and analytical queries within a single ACID transaction–at various isolation levels. We demonstrate this concept with a new service called  Hermes , which acts as a middleware that merges log records with analytical reads without altering existing engines. Our evaluation utilizes two AP engines, FlexPushdownDB  and  DuckDB , with  MySQL  as the TP engine. Using the  HATtrick  benchmark and a new workload called  Transactional Analytics Workload  (TAW), we compare Hermes with the leading HTAP solution,  TiDB . Our results indicate that Hermes performs comparably to current HTAP solutions for real-time analytics and surpasses them by  3 ×  in transactional analytics performance.",

    "title": "FB+-tree: A Memory-Optimized B+-tree with Latch-Free Update",
    "abstract": "B + -trees are prevalent in traditional database systems due to their versatility and balanced structure. While binary search is typically utilized for branch operations, it may lead to inefficient cache utilization in main-memory scenarios. In contrast, trie-based index structures drive branch operations through prefix matching. While these structures generally produce fewer cache misses and are thus increasingly popular, they may underperform in range scans because of frequent pointer chasing. \nThis paper proposes a new high-performance B + -tree variant called  Feature B + -tree (FB + -tree) . Similar to employing bit or byte for branch operation in tries, FB + -tree progressively considers several bytes following the common prefix on each level of its inner nodes—referred to as features, which allows FB + -tree to benefit from prefix skewness. FB + -tree blurs the lines between B + -trees and tries, while still retaining balance. In the best case, FB + -tree almost becomes a trie, whereas in the worst case, it continues to function as a B + -tree. Meanwhile, a crafted synchronization protocol that combines the link technique and optimistic lock is designed to support efficient concurrent index access. Distinctively, FB + -tree leverages subtle atomic operations seamlessly coordinated with optimistic lock to facilitate latch-free updates, which can be easily extended to other structures. Intensive experiments on multiple workloaddataset combinations demonstrate that FB + -tree shows comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art trie-based indexes and outperforms popular B + -trees by 2.3x  ∼ 3.7x under 96 threads. FB + -tree also exhibits significant potential on other workloads, especially update workloads under contention and scan workloads.",

    "title": "Fremer: Lightweight and Effective Frequency Transformer for Workload Forecasting in Cloud Services",
    "abstract": "Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this end, we propose  Fremer , an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.  Fremer  fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source workload datasets derived from ByteDance’s cloud services, encompassing workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that  Fremer  consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally, in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes,  Fremer  improves average latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its practical efficacy in real-world applications.",

    "title": "Buckaroo: A Direct Manipulation Visual Data Wrangler",
    "abstract": "Preparing datasets—a critical phase known as data wrangling— constitutes the dominant phase of data science development, consuming upwards of 80% of the total project time. This phase encompasses a myriad of tasks: parsing data, restructuring it for analysis, repairing inaccuracies, merging sources, eliminating duplicates, and ensuring overall data integrity. Traditional approaches, typically through manual coding in languages such as Python or using spreadsheets, are not only laborious but also error-prone. These issues range from missing entries and formatting inconsistencies to data type inaccuracies, all of which can affect the quality of downstream tasks if not properly corrected. To address these challenges, we present Buckaroo, a visualization system to highlight discrepancies in data and enable on-the-spot corrections through direct manipulations of visual objects. Buckaroo (1) automatically finds “interesting” data groups that exhibit anomalies compared to the rest of the groups and recommends them for inspection; (2) suggests wrangling actions that the user can choose to repair the anomalies; and (3) allows users to visually manipulate their data by displaying the effects of their wrangling actions and offering the ability to undo or redo these actions, which supports the iterative nature of data wrangling.",

    "abstract": "Conventional non-preemptive scheduling strategies struggle to meet the latency requirements of mixed workloads: low-priority, long-running analytics can dominate CPU cores while short, highpriority transactions wait a long time to be scheduled. Although preemptive scheduling appears to be a natural solution, it has long been discouraged in DBMSs by conventional wisdom due to concerns about deadlocks and interrupt-handling overheads. In this demonstration, we highlight that this is no longer the case with PreemptDB, a modern memory-optimized DBMS that we built around (1) optimistic concurrency and (2) userspace interrupts that recently became available in x86 CPUs. PreemptDB proposes user-interruptassisted context switching to renew preemptive scheduling in modern DBMSs. Through a set of demonstration scenarios, we show that preemptive scheduling is practical and prioritizes high-priority transactions while preserving throughput and fairness.",

    "title": "SkyStore: Cost-Optimized Object Storage Across Regions and Clouds",
    "abstract": "Modern applications span multiple clouds to reduce costs, avoid vendor lock-in, and leverage low-availability resources in another cloud. However, standard object stores operate within a single cloud, forcing users to manually manage data placement across clouds, i.e., navigate their diverse APIs and handle heterogeneous costs for network and storage. This is often a complex choice: users must either pay to store objects in a remote cloud, or pay to transfer them over the network based on application access patterns and cloud provider cost offerings. To address this, we present SkyStore, a unified object store that addresses cost-optimal data management across regions and clouds. SkyStore introduces a virtual object and bucket API to hide the complexity of interacting with multiple clouds. At its core, SkyStore has a novel TTL-based data placement policy that dynamically replicates and evicts objects according to application access patterns while optimizing for lower cost. Our evaluation shows that across various workloads, SkyStore reduces the overall cost by up to 6 ×  over academic baselines and commercial alternatives like AWS multi-region buckets. SkyStore also has comparable latency, and its availability and fault tolerance are on par with standard cloud offerings.",

With the prevalence of heterogeneous information networks (HINs) in real-world sce-of heterogeneous information networks (HINs) in real-world scenarios, it is of vital significance for a network embedding model to handle heterogeneity and capture as much semantic information as possible. Existing works can be roughly categorized into meta-as possible. Existing works can be roughly categorized into metapath-based and adjacent matrix-based methods depending on their definition of node neighborhoods. Meta-path-based methods aim to capture semantic similarities but require manual design. Adjacent matrix-based methods focus on structural information but may risk losing semantic context. In this work, we propose using schema instances representing node minimal complete contexts to embed HINs, aiming to integrate the advantages of both methods and avoid their deficiencies.

    "title": "GeoBloom: Revisiting Lightweight Models for Geographic Information Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) systems process text queries with geographic location to identify relevant geographic objects for users. Although recent advancements have leveraged Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for their robust semantic comprehension, these models typically depend on extensive labeled queries and re- quire considerable computational resources. Deviating from this prevailing trend, we propose GeoBloom, a lightweight framework that surpasses the effectiveness of PLMs with fewer or no labeled queries, with remarkable efficiency in both time and space.\nGeoBloom tackles critical challenges such as the lack of labeled queries, low data (labeled) efficiency, and high computational de- mands. At its core, it employs Bloom filters to encode text at a fine-grained term level and uses intersecting bits to create a ro- bust unsupervised text similarity metric. A specialized Bloom Filter Evaluator is proposed to assess the importance of each intersect- ing bit, focusing on those associated with ground truth, improving effectiveness with fewer training labels. For enhanced search effi- ciency, the evaluator exploits the inherent sparsity of Bloom filters, achieving remarkably low time and space complexities. This effi- ciency is further boosted by a tree-based index that partitions the search space while preserving effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GeoBloom surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both unsupervised (up to 15.66% improvement) and supervised settings (up to 10.94% improvement) on real datasets in terms of NDCG@5. Furthermore, GeoBloom operates up to 80x faster and saves up to 74.72% memory and 87.64% disk space over PLM-based alternatives, rendering it highly potent for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Fucci: Database Transaction Fuzzing via Random Conflict Construction and Multilevel Constraint Solving",
    "abstract": "Ensuring the ACID properties of transactions is the fundamental functionality of transactional DBMSs. However, through our study on existing solutions on transaction management, we found that transaction implementations in some mainstream databases, such as MySQL, MariaDB and TiDB, may violate what they claim in their documentation, in the form of incorrect database state or query results. Since there is still a lack of efficient and comprehensive testing methods to detect bugs within transaction management implementation for off-the-shelf DBMSs at present, we propose Fucci, a fuzzing framework, to solve the problem. Given a target DBMS, Fucci improves the efficiency of detecting transaction bugs through three key components: Random Conflict Construction (RCC), Multilevel Constraint Solving (MCS), and Experience-driven Automatic Simplification (EAS). RCC addresses the issue of inadequate case validity by ensuring the presence of read-write or write-write conflicts between transactions. MCS enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the transaction oracle by employing an external multi-version control system to solve data visibility. EAS is ultimately adopted to improve the efficiency of simplification and the readability of the identified bug cases. All of the above strategies are tested on commercial databases such as MySQL, MariaDB and TiDB. Accordingly, 6 previously unknown transaction bugs and 14 known duplicate transaction bugs have been newly discovered, most of which have been officially acknowledged.",

    "title": "Noise Matters: Cross Contrastive Learning for Flink Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Flink clusters often suffer from hotspot issues where the monitored job delay and CPU usage keep rising and remain high. This necessitates the detection of anomalous time series to pinpoint the hotspot machines. However, the state-of-the-art unsupervised time series anomaly detection (UTAD) methods are ineffective in this scenario. We identify two main reasons for this. First, the hotspot scenario requires us to pay particular attention to Flink-specific anomalies, e.g., slow-rising and high-level anomalies, which the existing methods struggle to address. Second, the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods often assume that training datasets do not contain anomalies, but the data collected from the running Flink clusters contains noise, which causes these methods to learn anomalous patterns as normal patterns. In this paper, we first conduct experiments to analyze why existing methods fail in the Flink scenario. To tackle these challenges, we propose a cross-contrastive approach to learn the context information for each timestamp to enable Flink-specific anomaly detection. Then, to address noisy anomalies, we incorporate prior knowledge to set an anomaly boundary to prevent the model from learning anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments show that our method not only outperforms existing methods in the Flink scenario but also achieves state-of-the-art results on public benchmark datasets.",

    "title": "Unleashing Graph Partitioning for Large-Scale Nearest Neighbor Search",
    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of decomposing a largescale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) problem into smaller sub-problems. The goal is to partition the input points into neighborhood-preserving  shards , so that the nearest neighbors of any point are contained in only a few shards. When a query arrives, a  routing  algorithm is used to identify the shards which should be searched for its nearest neighbors. This approach forms the backbone of distributed ANNS, where the dataset is so large that it must be split across multiple machines. \nIn this paper, we design simple and highly efficient routing methods based on clustering and locality-sensitive hashing. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for the LSH-based method, whereas the clustering-based method exhibits better empirical performance. A crucial characteristic of our routing algorithms is that they are inherently modular, and can be used with  any  partitioning method. This addresses a key drawback of prior approaches, where the routing algorithms are inextricably linked to their associated partitioning method. In particular, due to their modular structure, our routing methods enable the use of  balanced graph partitioning , which is a high-quality partitioning method without a naturally associated routing algorithm. Prior routing methods compatible with graph partitioning are too slow to train on large-scale data. \nWe provide the first routing methods that are simultaneously compatible with graph partitioning, fast to train, admit low latency, and achieve high recall. In a comprehensive evaluation of our partitioning and routing on billion-scale datasets, we show that our methods outperform existing scalable partitioning methods by significant margins, achieving up to 1 . 72 ×  higher QPS at 90% 10-recall than the best competitor and 1 . 27 ×  in the geometric mean. Through fast and modular routing we establish graph partitioning as the new method of choice for partitioning large-scale ANNS datasets.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale industrial recommendation systems, model checkpoints are instrumental in maintaining training goodput and numerical correctness during system failures and job preemptions. The increasing prevalence of multi-terabyte models has rendered frequent regular model checkpoints impractical, resulting in substantial lost progress when recovering from failures. As model sizes continue to grow, researchers and practitioners are compelled to investigate more e!cient and scalable solutions. This paper presents DECK, a novel approach to delta model checkpointing designed for real-world industrial systems. Specifically, DECK focuses on extracting delta states with near-zero overhead, staging and streaming delta checkpoints without interrupting the training process, and merging delta checkpoints in an optimal and decoupled manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DECK achieves a 12-fold increase in checkpoint frequency while maintaining negligible impact on training throughput, thereby attaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) production performance.",

    "title": "CUTTANA: Scalable Graph Partitioning for Faster Distributed Graph Databases and Analytics",
    "abstract": "Graph partitioning plays a pivotal role in various distributed graph processing applications, including graph analytics, graph neural network training, and distributed graph databases. A “good” graph partitioner reduces workload execution time, worker imbalance, and network overhead. Graphs that require distributed settings are often too large to fit in the main memory of a single machine. This challenge renders traditional in-memory graph partitioners infea- sible, leading to the emergence of streaming solutions. Streaming partitioners produce lower-quality partitions, because they work from partial information and must make premature decisions be- fore they have a complete view of a vertex’s neighborhood. We introduce CUTTANA, a streaming graph partitioner that partitions massive graphs (Web/Twitter scale) with superior quality compared to existing streaming solutions. CUTTANA uses a novel buffering technique that prevents the premature assignment of vertices to partitions and a scalable coarsening and refinement technique that enables a complete graph view, improving the intermediate assign- ment made by a streaming partitioner. We implemented a parallel version for CUTTANA that offers nearly the same partitioning latency as existing streaming partitioners.\nOur experimental analysis shows that CUTTANA consistently yields better partitioning quality than state-of-the-art streaming vertex partitioners in terms of both edge-cut and communication volume metrics. We also evaluate the workload latencies that re- sult from using CUTTANA and other partitioners in distributed graph analytics and databases. CUTTANA outperforms the other methods in most scenarios (algorithms, datasets). In analytics ap- plications, CUTTANA improves runtime performance by up to 59% compared to various streaming partitioners (i.e., HDRF, Fennel, Ginger, HeiStream). In graph database tasks, CUTTANA results in higher query throughput by up to 23%, without hurting tail latency.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new method for learned data cleaning. In contrast to existing methods, our method learns to clean data in the latent space. The main idea is that we (1) shape the latent space such that we know the area where clean data resides and (2) learn latent operators trained on error repair (Lopster) which shift erroneous data (e.g., table rows with noise, outliers, or missing values) in their latent representation back to a “clean” region, thus abstracting the complexities of the input domain. When formulating data cleaning as a simple shift operation in latent space, we can repair all types of errors using the same method which makes it more robust than other methods. Importantly, with our method, we can handle errors that are unseen during the training of our error repair model. We do not rely on an external error detection method as seen in the state-of-the-art, instead, we handle both detection and repair within the Lopster framework. In our evaluation, we show that our approach outperforms existing cleaning methods even when trained on only a subset of the errors that occur in the dirty data.",

    "abstract": "Modern analytical query engines ( AQEs ) are essential for large-scale data analysis and processing. These systems usually provide numerous query-level tunable knobs that signi!cantly a\"ect individual query performance. While several studies have explored automatic DBMS con!guration tuning, they have several limitations to handle query-level tuning. Firstly, they fail to capture how knobs influence query plans, which directly affect query performance. Secondly, they overlook query failures during the tuning processing, resulting in low tuning efficiency. Thirdly, they struggle with cold-start problems for new queries, leading to prolonged tuning time. To address these challenges, we propose  AQETuner , a novel Bayesian Optimization-based system tailored for  reliable  query-level knob tuning in  AQEs .  AQETuner  !rst applies the attention mechanisms to jointly encode the knobs and plan query, effectively identifying the impact of knobs on plan nodes. Then,  AQETuner  employs a dual-task Neural Process to predict both query performance and failures, leveraging their interactions to guide the tuning process. Furthermore,  AQETuner  utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization to ef!ciently generate high-quality samples in parallel during the initial tuning stage for the new queries.

    "abstract": "Ego-centric  queries, focusing on a target vertex and its direct neighbors, are essential for various applications. Enabling such queries on graphs owned by mutually distrustful data providers without breaching privacy holds promise for more comprehensive results. \nIn this paper, we propose  GORAM , a graph-oriented data structure that enables efficient ego-centric queries on federated graphs with strong privacy guarantees.  GORAM  leverages  secure multiparty computation (MPC)  and ensures that no information about the graphs or the querying keys is exposed during the process. For practical performance,  GORAM  partitions the federated graph and constructs an  Oblivious RAM (ORAM) -inspired index atop these partitions. This design enables each ego-centric query to process only a single partition, which can be accessed fast and securely. \nUtilizing  GORAM , we develop a prototype querying engine on a real-world MPC framework. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation using five commonly used queries similar to the LinkBench workload description [ 11 ] on both synthetic and real-world graphs. Our evaluation shows that all five queries can be completed in just 58.1 milliseconds to 35.7 seconds, even on graphs with up to 41.6 million vertices and 1.4 billion edges. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first instance of processing billion-scale graphs with practical performance on MPC.",

    "title": "PS-MI: Accurate, Efficient, and Private Data Valuation in Vertical Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) trains models when multiple databases (a.k.a participants) hold different features of the same set of samples. By quantifying each participant’s contribution to model training,  data valuation  can prevent hitch-riders and reward the instrumental parties. However, vertical federated data valuation (VFDV) is challenging because it needs to be accurate and efficient while protecting participant data privacy. In this paper, we propose a method meeting all three requirements by using  projection  and sampling  for  mutual information  estimation (thus dubbed PS-MI). In particular, we first show that the utility of a participant set (a.k.a a coalition ) can be expressed as the mutual information (MI) between their features and the target labels. MI is favorable because it does not depend on the model to train (i.e.,  model-agnostic ) and can be estimated via 𝑘 -nearest neighbor (KNN). To run KNN, instead of using costly homomorphic encryption to protect data privacy, we apply simple  random projection  to participant features before distance computation. We prove that random projection ensures differential privacy and preserves unbiased distance estimates. Since the contribution of a participant involves many coalitions, we adopt  stratified sampling  to reduce the number of coalitions while controlling estimation variance. To further improve efficiency, we incorporate optimizations including using locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to prune kNN candidates, batching kNN candidate checking for multiple coalitions, and adaptive early termination for utility evaluation. We compare PS-MI with 5 state-of-the-art VFDV methods. The results show that PS-MI yields higher accuracy and shorter running time than the baselines, and the maximum speedup can be 592 × .",

    "abstract": "The Compute Express Link (CXL) standard enables new forms of memory management and access across devices and servers. Based on PCIe, it enables cache-coherent access to remote memory. This widens the design space for database systems by expanding the available memory beyond memory local to the CPU. Efficiently utilizing CXL-attached memory requires conscious decisions by data systems about data placement and management. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of database operation performance with data interleaved across multiple CXL memory devices. We experimentally evaluate the memory access performance for basic access patterns, the performance impact of placing data across multiple CXL memory devices for in-memory column scans and inmemory B+tree operations, and the performance impact of placing data in CXL memory for an in-memory database system when running the analytical TPC-H workload. Our experiments show that access to CXL-attached memory does not have to penalize performance over local access, but careful workload-aware data management is required. Our TPC-H evaluation shows that placing table columns based on access frequencies allows storing over 80% of the table data in CXL memory with a performance of 85% of a local-memory-only solution.",

    "title": "RGS-Sketch: An Accurate, Invertible, and Mergeable Sketch for Online Super Spreader Detection in High-speed Data Streams",
    "abstract": "Super spreader detection in high-speed data streams is crucial for numerous applications. Although many methods have emerged, existing works can hardly concurrently achieve high memory efficiency, support online detection, enable merging data from different measurement points/periods, and offer invertibility. This makes them unable to satisfy flexible application requirements. This paper proposes RGS-Sketch, a novel sketch designed to address this problem. The core of RGS-Sketch lies in a new mergeable memory sharing design called register group sharing. This design organizes registers into groups as basic memory sharing units, accommodating the high skewness of real-world data streams and offering high memory efficiency. Besides, it enables online detection through the real-time acquisition of a group’s state, which also facilitates invertibility. To enhance detection accuracy further, we propose a limited register update strategy. It blocks small flows from updating registers, thereby reducing memory overhead and estimation noises. Extensive experimental results based on four real-world datasets show that RGS-Sketch significantly outperforms the most accurate baselines in accuracy while maintaining a high throughput. Specifically, it improves the F1 scores by up to 0.643 for measurements at a single point/period and up to 0.472 across multiple points/periods.",

    "title": "Balancing Privacy and Utility in Correlated Data: A Study of Bayesian Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Privacy risks in differentially private (DP) systems increase significantly when data is correlated, as standard DP metrics often underestimate the resulting privacy leakage, leaving sensitive information vulnerable. Given the ubiquity of dependencies in realworld databases, this oversight poses a critical challenge for privacy protections. Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) extends DP to account for these correlations, yet current BDP mechanisms indicate a notable utility loss, limiting its adoption. \nIn this work, we address whether BDP can be realistically implemented in common data structures without sacrificing utility—a key factor for its applicability. By analyzing arbitrary and structured correlation models, including Gaussian multivariate distributions and Markov chains, we derive practical utility guarantees for BDP. Our contributions include theoretical links between DP and BDP and a novel methodology to adapt DP mechanisms to meet the requirements of BDP. Through evaluations on real-world databases, we demonstrate that our novel theorems enable the design of BDP mechanisms that maintain competitive utility, paving the way for practical privacy-preserving data practices in correlated settings.",

    "title": "Kishu: Time-Traveling for Computational Notebooks",
    "abstract": "Computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, Google Colab) are widely used by data scientists. A key feature of notebooks is the interactive computing model of iteratively executing  cells  (i.e., a set of statements) and observing the result (e.g., model or plot). Unfortunately, existing notebook systems do not offer  time-traveling to past states : when the user executes a cell, the notebook  session state  consisting of user-defined variables can be  irreversibly modified Ðe.g., the user cannot ’un-drop’ a dataframe column. This is because, unlike DBMS, existing notebook systems do not keep track of the session state. Existing techniques for checkpointing and restoring session states, such as OS-level memory snapshot or application-level session dump, are insufficient: checkpointing can incur prohibitive storage costs and may fail, while restoration can only be inefficiently performed from scratch by fully loading checkpoint files. \nIn this paper, we introduce a new notebook system,  Kishu , that offers time-traveling to and from arbitrary notebook states using an efficient and fault-tolerant incremental checkpoint and checkout mechanism.  Kishu  creates incremental checkpoints that are small and correctly preserve complex inter-variable dependencies at a novel  Co-variable  granularity. Then, to return to a previous state, Kishu  accurately identifies the  state difference  between the current and target states to perform incremental checkout at sub-second latency with minimal data loading.  Kishu  is compatible with 146 object classes from popular data science libraries (e.g., Ray, Spark, PyTorch), and reduces checkpoint size and checkout time by up to 4.55 ×  and 9.02 × , respectively, on a variety of notebooks.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) platforms allow the sharing of knowledge with multiple owners. While data owners can share their data with others by encrypting their data before sharing it, this naïve approach prevents data encrypted by different owners from being queried together, as it compromises query verifiability, an essential DKG platform feature. We propose Pistis, the first DKG platform capable of preserving ownership while also enabling verifiable SPARQL queries. Two novel techniques facilitate this: owner-managed end-to-end encryption  and  collaborative query verification . In Pistis, data owners thus encrypt their data individually and collaborate to construct an authenticated data structure (ADS) with a global key by means of secret sharing and secure multi-party computation. Then, by indexing KG data as ciphertext over the ADS, Pistis offers a cryptographic scheme called VO-SPARQL that facilitates verifiable queries on encrypted KG data with multiple owners. Pistis provides succinct proofs for two-stage SPARQL queries, including subgraph queries based on the ADS and aggregation on encrypted intermediate results based on a key-aggregate cryptographic primitive. A theoretical analysis and an empirical study provide detailed insight into the performance of Pistis while offering provable security.",

    "title": "Towards Pattern-aware Data Augmentation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion",
    "abstract": "Predicting missing facts for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a fundamental task, called temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC). One key challenge in this task is the imbalance in data distribution, where facts are unevenly spread across entities and timestamps. This imbalance can lead to poor completion performance for long-tail entities and timestamps, and unstable training due to the introduction of false negative samples. Unfortunately, few previous studies have investigated how to mitigate these effects. Moreover, for the first time, we found that existing methods suffer from model preferences, revealing that entities with specific properties (e.g., recently active) are favored by different models. Such preferences will lead to error accumulation and further exacerbate the effects of imbalanced data distribution. To alleviate the impacts of imbalanced data and model preferences, we introduce  Booster , the first data augmentation strategy for TKGs. The unique requirements here lie in generating new samples that fit the complex semantic and temporal patterns within TKGs, and identifying hard-learning samples specific to models. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical scoring algorithm based on triadic closures within TKGs. By incorporating both global semantic patterns and local time-aware structures, the algorithm enables pattern-aware validation for new samples. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage training approach to identify samples that deviate from the model’s preferred patterns. With a frequency-based filtering strategy, this approach also helps to avoid the misleading of false negatives. Experiments justify that Booster  can seamlessly adapt to existing TKGC models and achieve on average 4.5% performance improvement.",

    "abstract": "Sorting is a fundamental operation in table analysis. Data scientists frequently sort tables to uncover key insights—for example, identifying the top 10 products by sales. However, this process is largely manual. Data scientists must (1) understand the semantics behind the sorting they wish to apply, and (2) ensure the necessary attributes are present—often requiring manual augmentation of the table. But what if data scientists could receive suggestions for semantically meaningful ways to sort a table, powered by automatic augmentations from a data lake? In this demo, we present InsightSort, an end-to-end system that recommends attribute augmentations to enable richer, more insightful sorting for table exploration. InsightSort works by: (1) discovering potential augmentations by linking the input table with relevant data lake tables, and (2) leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize the top-k diverse sorting attributes based on their semantics.

    "title": "Practical and Accurate Local Edge Differentially Private Graph Algorithms",
    "abstract": "The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using  local differential privacy (LDP) , which enforces privacy at the individual level, where  no third-party entity is trusted , unlike centralized models that assume a trusted curator. \nWe introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph statistics:  𝑘 -core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages input-dependent private graph properties—specifically degeneracy and maximum degree—to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior methods, our error bounds depend on the maximum degree rather than the total edge count, yielding significantly tighter guarantees. For triangle counting, we improve on the work of Imola, Murakami, and Chaudhury [USENIX Security ’21, ’22], which bounds error in terms of edge count. Our algorithm instead achieves bounds based on degeneracy by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et al.’s randomized response technique [ICALP ’23], and a novel analysis, yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. \nBeyond theoretical gains, we are the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show substantial accuracy gains: our  𝑘 -core decomposition achieves errors within  3 x  of exact values, far outperforming the  131 x  error in the baseline of Dhulipala et al. [FOCS ‘22]. Our triangle counting algorithm reduces multiplicative approximation errors by up to  six orders of magnitude , while maintaining competitive runtime.",

    "abstract": "As data is increasingly held at the edge of the network, new methods are needed to perform analysis over distributed inputs. This has led to the emergence of the federated model of distributed computation, which places emphasis on privacy and scalability. A central problem is to analyze data distributions where the data is spread across a large number of distributed clients. This supports a number of tasks within federated learning and federated analytics. We present techniques to measure the similarity of distributions of data in the federated model. We deﬁne sketches for this task that allow eﬃcient estimation of the diﬀerence between two distributions based on the total variation distance ( 퐿 1 ) metric. These have accuracy and privacy guarantees, and can be computed incrementally over dynamic data. Our experimental study shows that these are practical to implement and provide accurate estimates.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have developed LLM-powered data systems that enable database-like analysis of unstructured text documents. While LLMs excel at attribute extraction from documents, their high computational costs and latency make extraction operations the primary performance bottleneck. Existing systems typically adopt traditional relational database query optimization strategies, which prove ineffective in minimizing LLM-related expenses. To fill this gap, we propose  DocDB , a prototype system that features a bunch of novel optimization strategies designated to unstructured document analysis. First, we employ a two-level index to reduce LLM extraction costs by selectively retrieving and processing only text segments relevant to target attributes. Second,  DocDB  employs adaptive execution, generating document-specific plans to minimize LLM extraction frequency based on varying per-document attribute extraction costs. With a real-life scenario, we demonstrate that  DocDB allows users to analyze unstructured documents accurately and affordably using SQL-like queries.

    "abstract": "Most enterprise graph data derives from relational databases, yet transforming relational tables into query-optimized graph schemas remains challenging. Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) transformations based on primary and foreign keys often fail to generate schemas optimized for query performance; (2) manual schema design, although flexible, is costly and requires domain expertise; and (3) machine learning methods predict graph structures based on data patterns but heavily depend on large, high-quality training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose GalaxyWeaver, a framework to automate query-aware graph schema generation. GalaxyWeaver utilizes the reasoning power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to align graph schema designs with specific query requirements, e#ectively integrating domain knowledge with optimization strategies. The framework employs prompt-guided analysis to enhance the decision-making accuracy of LLM agents, facilitating iterative schema refinement. Experiments across diverse domains show that GalaxyWeaver simplifies transformation while improving query performance and reducing storage costs.",

    "abstract": "Conventional consensus algorithms, such as Paxos and Raft, encounter inefficiencies when applied to large-scale distributed systems due to the requirement of waiting for replies from a majority of nodes. To address these challenges, we propose Cabinet, a novel consensus algorithm that introduces dynamically weighted con- sensus, allocating distinct weights to nodes based on any given failure thresholds. Cabinet dynamically adjusts nodes’ weights according to their responsiveness, assigning higher weights to faster nodes. The dynamic weight assignment maintains an optimal system performance, especially in large-scale and heterogeneous systems where node responsiveness varies. We evaluate Cabinet against Raft with distributed MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases using YCSB and TPC-C workloads. The evaluation results show that Cabinet outperforms Raft in throughput and latency under increasing system scales, complex networks, and failures in both homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, offering a promising high-performance consensus solution.",

    "title": "Select Edges Wisely: Monotonic Path Aware Graph Layout Optimization for Disk-based ANN Search",
    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a critical problem in various real-world applications. However, as one of the most promising solutions to ANN search, graph-based indexes often suffer from high memory consumption. Although a few studies attempt to alleviate this issue by storing the index on inexpensive disk storage, they still face challenges such as insufficient data locality and low efficiency when optimizing the graph layout on disk. Therefore, we propose  MARGO , a monotonic path-aware graph layout optimization method for disk-based ANN search. First, we present the essence of graph layout optimization in disk-based ANN search, and design a monotonic path-aware objective function that weighs the edges based on their importance in monotonic paths, supported by rigorous theoretical analysis. Second, we propose a greedy algorithm that prioritizes high-weight edges to accommodate more monotonic paths. To enhance efficiency,  MARGO  introduces a two stage decoupling method that processes intra-cluster edges in parallel first, followed by inter-cluster edges. Third, we develop a weight computation strategy that computes edge weights on-the-fly during index construction with almost no additional overhead. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that  MARGO  improves search efficiency by up to 26.6% while maintaining the same recall, and accelerates the graph layout optimization by up to 5.5 × .",

This paper presents a novel vision to align causal analysis with property graphs—the foundation of modern graph databases—by rethinking graph models to incorporate hypernodes, structural equations, and causality-aware query semantics. By unifying graph databases with causal reasoning, our approach enables the declarative expression of DAG manipulation operations along with interventions and counterfactuals, combining expressiveness with computational efficiency.

    "title": "InBox: Recommendation with Knowledge Graph using Interest Box Embedding",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become vitally important in modern recommender systems, effectively improving performance and interpretability. Fundamentally, recommender systems aim to identify user interests based on historical interactions and recommend suitable items. However, existing works overlook two key challenges: (1) an interest corresponds to a potentially large set of related items, and (2) the lack of explicit, fine-grained exploitation of KG information and interest connectivity. This leads to an inability to reflect distinctions between entities and interests when modeling them in a single way. Additionally, the granularity of concepts in the knowledge graphs used for recommendations tends to be coarse, failing to match the fine-grained nature of user interests. This homogenization limits the precise exploitation of knowledge graph data and interest connectivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel embedding-based model called InBox. Specifically, various knowledge graph entities and relations are embedded as points or boxes, while user interests are modeled as boxes encompassing interaction history. Representing interests as boxes enables containing collections of item points related to that interest. We further propose that an interest comprises diverse basic concepts, and box intersection naturally supports concept combination. Across three training steps, InBox significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HAKG and KGIN on recommendation tasks. Further analysis provides meaningful insights into the variable value of different KG data for recommendations.",

    "title": "Wolverine: Highly Efficient Monotonic Search Path Repair for Graph-based ANN Index Updates",
    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search on high-dimensional vector data is core functionality in an increasing number of realworld applications. However, most existing methods only focus on accelerating search by means of indexing that assumes that the data is static. The few methods capable of contending with dynamic data often face challenges such as decreased query accuracy following updates and low update efficiency. In this study, we propose Wolverine , the first proposal that, to our knowledge, enables efficient monotonic search path repair, thereby solving the graph-based ANN index update problem.  Wolverine  repairs disrupted monotonic search paths by adding in-edges to the out-neighbors of a point to be deleted. To improve efficiency,  Wolverine+  restricts the search space to be within the 2-hop neighbors of the point to be deleted. In addition,  Wolverine++  employs a sophisticated candidate selection policy to find high-quality candidates in the reduced search space, simultaneously improving accuracy and efficiency. An experimental study on 9 real-world datasets demonstrates that  Wolverine is capable of accelerating the deletion throughput by up to 11 × and achieving more stable recall during updates compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic ANN search method.",

    "abstract": "Frequent subgraph mining is an important and well-studied prob- lem with numerous applications such as the prediction of protein functionalities and graph indexing. Many studies use the minimum- image-based support (MNI) to measure the frequency of subgraphs in single graph mining. Given a graph G and an integer k, top-k frequent subgraph mining is to ￿nd top-: frequent subgraphs in the graph ⌧ based on MNI. However, there are two main challenges in top-k frequent subgraph mining. (1) Computing MNI is time- consuming. (2) The number of subgraphs for which MNI should be computed is large. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm Minting to address these challenges. We propose a method to significantly reduce the number of subgraphs for which MNI computation is required by using a tight upper bound of the MNI value. We also improve the computation of MNI itself by utilizing both a lower bound and an upper bound of the MNI value. Experiments shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by up to three orders of magnitude in terms of the elapsed time. Our algorithm is also a feasible solution for this challenging problem, even for large k.",

    "abstract": "Inductive Recommender Systems are capable of recommending for new users and with new items thus avoiding the need to retrain after new data reaches the system. However, these methods are still trained on all the data available, requiring multiple days to train a single model, without counting hyperparameter tuning. In this work we focus on graph-based recommender systems, i.e., systems that model the data as a heterogeneous network. In other applications, graph sampling allows to study a subgraph and generalize the findings to the original graph. Thus, we investigate the applicability of sampling techniques for this task. We test on three real world datasets, with three state-of-the-art inductive methods, and using six different sampling methods. We find that its possible to maintain performance using only 50% of the training data with up to 86% percent decrease in training time; however, using less training data leads to far worse performance. Further, we find that when it comes to data for recommendations, graph sampling should also account for the temporal dimension. Therefore, we find that if higher data reduction is needed, new graph based sampling techniques should be studied and new inductive methods should be designed.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction (LP) is crucial for Knowledge Graphs (KG) completion but commonly suffers from interpretability issues. While several methods have been proposed to explain embedding-based LP models, they are generally limited to local explanations on KG and are deficient in providing human interpretable semantics. Based on real-world observations of the characteristics of KGs from multiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with pathbased explanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably, the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath’s ability to provide more semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.",

    "title": "Optimized Batch Prompting for Cost-effective LLMs",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in various real-world data management tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which involves structuring prompts with task descriptions and several demonstrations. However, most LLMs are not free and charge based on the number of input tokens. Specifically, for data management tasks, there may be massive related questions, leading to high inference cost due to redundant prompt content (i.e., overlapping demonstrations and repeated task descriptions). In this paper, we investigate the idea of batch prompting in leveraging LLMs for data management, which leads to cost-effective LLMs by grouping questions and demonstrations to perform inferences in batches. Current studies on batch prompting are preliminary and mostly based on heuristics, making it difficult to generalize to various types of tasks and adapt to different grouping strategies. To address these challenges, in this work we first formalize the batch prompting problem in general setting. Then, we study the hardness of this problem and propose efficient algorithms for adaptive grouping. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 14 datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines while consuming lower cost.",

    "abstract": "User-defined functions (UDFs) extend the expressiveness of declarative SQL with functional capabilities, but also pose a core bottleneck in query processing due to the impedance mismatch between the UDF and SQL execution environments, and the limitations of the query optimizers to consistently produce good plans for UDF queries. Research and commercial approaches propose remedies for performant UDF query execution ranging from logical optimization and heuristics to physical optimization and compilation techniques. Each work however follows a different path to evaluate their proposed techniques. Despite the practical significance of optimizing UDF queries, UDFs have not been so far the focus of the database benchmarks. In this paper, we present UDFBench, a UDF-centric database benchmark based on real-world schema and data. We identify the core overheads in UDF query execution and design the UDFBench UDFs and queries to enable experimentation with these overheads, alone or in tandem with others. Finally, to showcase the portability and scope of UDFBench, we present an experimental analysis on five popular databases with different characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size  𝑑 for each node, resulting in a parameter complexity of  O( 𝑛 × 𝑑 ) , where 𝑛 represents the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose  Lighter-X , an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters, identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of  O( ℎ ×  𝑑 ) , where  ℎ ≪ 𝑛 . Furthermore, the model is optimized through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with only 1% of the parameter over LightGCN.",

    "title": "A Practical Theory of Generalization in Selectivity Learning",
    "abstract": "Query-driven machine learning models  have emerged as a promising estimation technique for query selectivities. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the efficacy of these techniques from a theoretical perspective, as there exist substantial gaps between practical solutions and state-of-the-art (SOTA) theory based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between theory and practice. First, we demonstrate that selectivity predictors induced by  signed measures are learnable, which relaxes the reliance on  probability measures  in SOTA theory. More importantly, beyond the PAC learning framework (which only allows us to characterize how the model behaves when both training and test workloads are drawn from the  same distribution), we establish, under mild assumptions, that selectivity predictors from this class exhibit favorable  out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error bounds. \nThese theoretical advances provide us with a better understanding of both the in-distribution and OOD generalization capabilities of query-driven selectivity learning, and facilitate the design of two general strategies to improve OOD generalization for existing query-driven selectivity models. We empirically verify that our techniques help query-driven selectivity models generalize significantly better to OOD queries both in terms of prediction accuracy and query latency performance, while maintaining their superior in-distribution generalization performance.",

    "title": "PipeTGL: (Near) Zero Bubble Memory-based Temporal Graph Neural Network Training via Pipeline Optimization",
    "abstract": "Memory-based Temporal Graph Neural Networks  (M-TGNNs) demonstrate superior performance in dynamic graph learning tasks. Their success attributes to a memory module, which captures historical information for each node and implicitly creates a memory dependency constraint among chronologically ordered minibatches. This unique characteristic of M-TGNN introduces new challenges for parallel training that have not been encountered before. Existing parallelism strategies for M-TGNN either sacriﬁce memory accuracy (minibatch parallelism and epoch parallelism) or compromise space eﬃciency (memory parallelism) to optimize runtime. This paper proposes a pipeline parallel approach for multi-GPU M-TGNN training that eﬀectively addresses both inter-minibatch memory dependencies and intra-minibatch task dependencies, based on a runtime analysis DAG for M-TGNNs. We further optimize pipeline eﬃciency by incorporating improved scheduling, ﬁner-grained operation reorganization, and targeted communication optimizations tailored to the speciﬁc training properties of M-TGNN. These enhancements signiﬁcantly reduce GPU waiting and idle time caused by memory dependencies and frequent communication and result in zero pipeline bubbles for common training conﬁgurations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PipeTGL achieves a speedup of 1.27x to 4.74x over other baselines while also improving the accuracy of M-TGNN training across multiple GPUs.",

    "title": "Diva: Dynamic Range Filter for Var-Length Keys and Queries",
    "abstract": "Range filters are compact probabilistic data structures that answer approximate range emptiness queries. They are used in many domains, e.g., in key-value stores, to quickly rule out the existence of keys in a given query range and avoid having to search for them in storage. However, all existing range filters exhibit at least one of the following shortcomings: (1) they do not provide robust false positive rate and performance guarantees, (2) they do not support variable-length keys and query ranges, and (3) they do not allow dynamic operations such as insertions, deletions, or expansions. \nWe introduce Diva, the first range filter to address all the above challenges simultaneously. Diva learns the dataset’s distribution by sampling keys and storing them in a cache-efficient trie. It compresses the keys in-between samples by removing their longest common prefix and truncating their suffixes while leaving enough bits in the middle (i.e., an infix) to allow differentiating between the keys in the sorted order. It stores infixes in constant time dynamic data blocks, which it splits to handle insertions and expansions. It processes a range query by traversing the trie and checking for the inclusion of infixes in the target query range. \nWe show, theoretically and empirically, that Diva achieves a false positive rate on par with the state of the art on real-world datasets while supporting dynamicity and variable-length queries and keys.",

    "title": "Jodes: Efficient Oblivious Join in the Distributed Setting",
    "abstract": "Trusted execution environment (TEE) has provided an isolated and secure environment for building cloud-based analytic systems, but it still suffers from access pattern leakages caused by side- channel attacks. To better secure the data, computation inside TEE enclave should be made oblivious, which introduces significant overhead and severely slows down the computation. A natural way to speed up is to build the analytic system with multiple servers in the distributed setting. However, this setting raises a new security concern—the volumes of the transmissions among these servers can leak sensitive information to a network adversary. Existing works have designed specialized algorithms to address this concern, but their supports for equi-join, one of the most important but non- trivial database operators, are either inefficient, limited, or under a weak security assumption.\nIn this paper, we present Jodes, an efficient oblivious join al- gorithm in the distributed setting. Jodes prevents the leakage on both the network and enclave sides, supports a general equi-join operation, and provides a high security level protection that only publicizes the input sizes and the output size. Meanwhile, it achieves both communication cost and computation cost asymptotically su- perior to existing algorithms. To demonstrate the practicality of Jodes, we conduct experiments in the distributed setting compris- ing 16 servers. Empirical results show that Jodes achieves up to a sixfold performance improvement over state-of-the-art join algo- rithms.",

    "abstract": "Memory channel bandwidth imposes an upper bound on the performance of online transaction processing (OLTP) on in-memory database management systems (DBMS). Emerging processing-inmemory (PIM) hardware has the potential to overcome this barrier by using small cores in DRAM chips that can read and process data in situ, thereby avoiding moving these data across memory channels. However, naïvely offoading all database components to PIM does not solve the problem due to the characteristics of software components and the limitations of PIM hardware. \nIn this paper, we present  OLTPim , the first end-to-end OLTP DBMS designed for PIM systems. We build a formalized model for the affinity of each database operation towards PIM and use it to decide the partitioning of components on different types of memory. We also design a lightweight batching algorithm to overcome the large PIM control latency while minimizing the batching overhead. We implement and evaluate  OLTPim  on the latest PIM system from UPMEM with 64 worker threads and 2048 PIM modules. Our results show that  OLTPim  achieves up to 1 . 71 → throughput and up to 6 . 14 → less per-transaction memory channel traffic over MosaicDB, a state-of-the-art in-memory system.",

    "abstract": "Proximity graphs (PG) have gained increasing popularity as the state-of-the-art solutions to  𝑘 -approximate nearest neighbor ( 𝑘 ANN) search on high-dimensional data, which serves as a fundamental function in various fields, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation. Although PG-based approaches have the best  𝑘 -ANN search performance, their index construction cost is superlinear to the number of points. Such superlinear cost substantially limits their scalability in the era of big data. Hence, the goal of this paper is to accelerate the construction of PG-based methods without compromising their  𝑘 -ANN search performance. \nTo achieve this goal, two mainstream categories of PG are revisited: relative neighborhood graph (RNG) and navigable small world graph (NSWG). By revisiting their construction process, we find the issues of construction efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a new construction framework with a novel pruning strategy for edge selection, which accelerates RNG construction while keeping its  𝑘 -ANN search performance. Then, we integrate this framework into NSWG construction to enhance both the construction efficiency and  𝑘 -ANN search performance of NSWG. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our construction framework for both RNG and NSWG, and that it significantly reduces the PG construction cost, achieving up to 5.6x speedup, while not compromising the  𝑘 -ANN search performance.",

    "abstract": "Relational database design is a well-understood process enabled by a combination of database theory (e.g., normal forms) as well as conceptual modeling (e.g., ER-based design). In contrast, database design for NoSQL databases, notably document databases, is often approached in a much more ad hoc manner. It is frequently driven by application details and physical considerations that muddy the design process in ways all too reminiscent of the pre-relational database era. In this paper, we argue for a return to sanity – for a logical, data-ﬁrst, conceptually grounded approach to document database design. We explain how such an approach can work, yielding a clean, query-friendly document database design. We also highlight a collection of document (JSON) anti-patterns to avoid. The process and the anti-patterns both stem from the authors’ experiences in current and past lives when dealing with a wide variety of JSON document data from commercial applications, government applications, and university research applications.",

This paper introduces  PAR 2 QO ( PAR ametric  P enalty- A ware  R obust  Q uery  O ptimization), a system that integrates robust query optimization into PQO.  PAR 2 QO strategically obtains plans from a well-balanced set of probe locations informed by the workload, and caches them as plan-penalty profiles. At runtime,  PAR 2 QO  selects the plan with the lowest expected penalty, explicitly accounting for selectivity uncertainties. Extensive experiments show that  PAR 2 QO  delivers significant speedups over existing methods while ensuring robustness against performance degradation. Additionally, we introduce  CARVER , a workload generator aimed at covering possible cardinalities of subqueries. Not only does  CARVER  provide a more comprehensive way to evaluate PQO methods, but when used for training learned methods, it can also enhance their generalizability and stability.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data is often positioned as a solution to replace sensitive fixed-size data sets with a source of unlimited matching data, freed from privacy concerns. There has been much progress in synthetic data generation over the last decade, leveraging corresponding advances in machine learning and data analytics. In this tutorial, we survey the key developments and the main concepts in tabular synthetic data generation, including paradigms based on probabilistic graphical models and on deep learning. We provide background and motivation, before giving a technical deep-dive into the methodologies. We also address the limitations of synthetic data, by studying attacks that seek to retrieve information about the original sensitive data. Finally, we present extensions and open problems in this area. KEYWORDS synthetic data, differential privacy, marginal distributions, membership inference.",

    "abstract": "Functional dependency (FD) discovery is fundamental in data profiling. Inevitably, existing approaches can return fake FDs that hold only coincidentally. Moreover, these approaches fall short of identifying ghost FDs that would be observable in a clean dataset, but that remain undetected because of outliers in the data. We introduce an interactive method for dependency discovery that augments an Armstrong relation with additional tuples. We rely on artificially generated  negative examples  that emulate real-world tuples to help expose fake FDs. In addition, we rely on domain experts to confirm that  positive examples  indeed reflect the characteristics of the original dataset. Our tool prototype  FDepHunter  thus provides a novel human-in-the-loop workflow where the set of discovered FDs can be iteratively refined.",

    "abstract": "Data practitioners often sample their datasets to produce representative subsets for their downstream tasks. When entities in a dataset can be partitioned into multiple groups, str atif i ed sampling is commonly used to produce subsets that match a target group distribution, e.g., to select a balanced subset for training a machine learning model. However, real-world data frequently contains duplicates — multiple representations of the same real-world entity — that can bias sampling, necessitating deduplication. \nWe define  deduplicated sampling  as the task of producing a clean sample of a dirty dataset according to a target group distribution. The naïve approach to deduplicated sampling would first deduplicate the entire dataset upfront, then perform sampling  ex post . However, that approach might be prohibitively expensive for large datasets and time/resource constraints.  Deduplicated sampling ondemand  with RadlER is a novel approach to produce a clean sample by focusing the cleaning effort only on entities required to appear in that sample. Our experimental evaluation, performed on multiple datasets from different domains, demonstrates that RadlER consistently outperforms baseline approaches, providing data scientists with an efficient solution to quickly produce a clean sample of a dirty dataset according to a target group distribution.",

    "abstract": "A Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) combines a large language model (LLM) with a vector database to retrieve context- specific knowledge during text generation. This strategy facilitates impressive generation quality even with smaller models, thus re- ducing computational demands by orders of magnitude. To serve RALMs efficiently and flexibly, we propose Chameleon, a heteroge- neous accelerator system integrating both LLM and vector search accelerators in a disaggregated architecture. The heterogeneity en- sures efficient serving for both inference and retrieval, while the disaggregation allows independent scaling of LLM and vector search accelerators to fulfill diverse RALM requirements. Our Chameleon prototype implements vector search accelerators on FPGAs and assigns LLM inference to GPUs, with CPUs as cluster coordina- tors. Evaluated on various RALMs, Chameleon exhibits up to 2.16× reduction in latency and 3.18× speedup in throughput compared to the hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. The promising results pave the way for adopting heterogeneous accelerators for not only LLM inference but also vector search in future RALM systems.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph storage systems are essential for real-time applications such as social networks and recommendation, where the graph continuously evolves. However, they face significant challenges in efficiently handling concurrent read and write operations. We find that existing methods suffer from write queries interfering with read efficiency, substantial time and space overhead due to per-edge versioning, and an inability to balance performance, such as slow searches. To address these issues, we propose RapidStore, a holistic approach for efficient in-memory dynamic graph storage designed for read-intensive workloads. Our key idea is to exploit the characteristics of graph queries through a decoupled system design that separates the management of read and write queries and decouples version data from graph data. Besides, we design an efficient dynamic graph store to cooperate with the graph concurrency control mechanism. Experiments show that RapidStore enables fast and scalable concurrent graph queries, effectively balancing the performance of inserts, searches, and scans, and significantly improving efficiency in dynamic graph storage systems.",

    "title": "Eventual Durability",
    "abstract": "For latency-critical transactional applications, durability is often what limits performance. That is, executing transactions is fast, but guaranteeing that they are durable is slow. As a result, most of each transaction’s latency is attributable to durability. To address this problem, some database systems allow applications to sacrifice durability guarantees in exchange for lower transaction latencies. These ad hoc techniques are effective, but they can make it difficult for applications to understand and manage the risks associated with failures.\nIn this paper, our goal is to offer a more principled foundation for these kinds of performance/durability tradeoffs. The major obstacle to doing this is the transaction model itself, because it couples transaction durability with transaction commit. That is, the model defines a single point at which a transaction becomes visible and durable. This forces all transaction guarantees to wait for the slowest one, which is often durability.\nThe primary contribution of this work is a new eventually durable transaction model, which decouples commit from durability. Transactions commit first, and become durable later. We argue for making this model the basis of the contract between transactional data systems and applications. We describe what it means to correctly implement eventually durable transactions, and consider how they can be exposed to applications. We also describe a prototype implementation of eventual durability in PostgreSQL, and show that it enables applications to reduce transaction latencies while managing the durability risks.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent indexes are hard to build by requiring complex, careful yet error-prone processes of design and implementation. As prior work has observed, modeling indexes as transactional tables can largely ease programming. The developer only needs to write singlethreaded logic without worrying about concurrency or persistence, which are transparently supported by ACID table operations. However, this was deemed infeasible due to high overheads caused by the underlying OLTP engine. \nIn this paper, we argue that by adapting recent OLTP techniques which have been shown to deliver unprecedented performance, this idea is now feasible. We propose Tabular, a new library for building efficient indexes by modeling indexes as ACID tables which provide concurrency and persistence transparently. We elaborate the design of Tabular and its use cases. Our evaluation shows that compared to hand-crafted ones, indexes built using Tabular provide competitive performance with improved programming efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing opportunities are everywhere, but privacy concerns and regulatory constraints often prevent organizations from fully realizing their value. A private data federation tackles this challenge by enabling secure querying across multiple privately held data stores where only the final results are revealed to anyone. We investigate optimizing relational queries evaluated under secure multiparty computation, which provides strong privacy guarantees but at a significant performance cost. \nWe present Alchemy, a query optimization framework that generalizes conventional optimization techniques to secure query processing over circuits, the most popular paradigm for cryptographic computation protocols. We build atop VaultDB, our open-source framework for oblivious query processing. Alchemy leverages schema information and the query’s structure to minimize circuit complexity while maintaining strong security guarantees. Our optimization framework builds incrementally through four synergistic phases: (1) rewrite rules to minimize circuits; (2) cardinality bounding with schema metadata; (3) bushy plan generation; and (4) physical planning with our fine-grained cost model for operator selection and sort reuse. While our work focuses on MPC, our optimization techniques generalize naturally to other secure computation settings. We validated our approach on TPC-H, demonstrating speedups of up to 2 OOM.",

This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.

    "abstract": "Time-series clustering is a key task in time series analysis, enabling unsupervised data exploration and often serving as a subroutine for other tasks. Despite decades of active cross-disciplinary research, benchmarking of time-series clustering methods has received limited attention. Existing studies have (i) excluded popular methods and entire method classes; (ii) used a narrow range of distance measures; (iii) evaluated only a few datasets; (iv) lacked statistical validation; (v) had poor reproducibility; or (vi) relied on questionable evaluation setups. The rise of deep learning—especially foundation models claiming broad generalization—further emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation, as their role in time-series clustering remains largely untested. To address these gaps, we evaluate 84 time-series clustering methods across 10 method classes from data mining, machine learning, and deep learning. Our analysis spans 128 time-series datasets and uses rigorous statistical methods. Within a fair comparison framework, we (i) identify the top-performing method in each class; (ii) highlight previously overlooked, high-performing classes; (iii) challenge assumptions about elastic distance measures; (iv) refute the claimed superiority of deep learning methods, including foundation models; (v) expose reproducibility issues; (vi) analyze performance variation across dataset properties; and (vii) assess scalability. Our findings reveal an illusion of progress: no method significantly outperforms the decade-old 𝑘 -Shape method. Still, we highlight a deep learning-based approach with notable promise. Our results provide a strong benchmark for advancing time-series clustering, and we have open-sourced our work to support future research.",

    "title": "When Speed meets Accuracy: an Efficient and Effective Graph Model for Temporal Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates shortterm temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node’s most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against stateof-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50× speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.",

    "title": "ArrayMorph: Optimizing Hyperslab Queries on the Cloud for Machine Learning Pipelines",
    "abstract": "Cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage are widely used to store raw data for machine learning applications. When the data is later processed, the analysis predominantly focuses on regions of interest (such as a small bounding box in a larger image) and discards uninteresting regions. Machine learning applications can signiﬁcantly accelerate their I/O if they push this data ﬁltering step to the cloud. Prior work has proposed diﬀerent methods to partially read array (tensor) objects, such as chunking, reading a contiguous byte range, and evaluating a lambda function. No method is optimal; estimating the total time and cost of a data retrieval requires an understanding of the data serialization order, the chunk size and platform-speciﬁc properties. This paper introduces ArrayMorph, a cloud-based array data storage system that automatically determines which is the best method to use to retrieve regions of interest from data on the cloud. ArrayMorph formulates data accesses as hyperslab queries, and optimizes them using a multi-phase cost-based approach. ArrayMorph seamlessly integrates with Python/PyTorch-based ML applications, and is experimentally shown to transfer up to 9.8X less data than existing systems. This makes ML applications run up to 1.7X faster and 9X cheaper than prior solutions.",

    "title": "QUEST: Query Optimization in Unstructured Document Analysis",
    "abstract": "Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs) powered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents like working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting attributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations constitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high monetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the query optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query execution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To fill this gap, we propose  QUEST , which features a bunch of novel optimization strategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an index-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With this index,  QUEST  quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target attributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an evidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing relevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution strategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly document by document, QUEST  produces different plans for different documents. For each document,  QUEST  produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute extraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies and an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters. Extensive experiments on 3 realworld datasets demonstrate the superiority of  QUEST , achieving 30%-6 ×  cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high computational throughput of GPUs, limited memory capacity and bandwidth-limited CPU-GPU communication via PCIe links remain significant bottlenecks for accelerating largescale data analytics workloads. This paper introduces  Vortex , a GPU-accelerated framework designed for data analytics workloads that exceed GPU memory capacity. A key aspect of our framework is an optimized IO primitive that leverages all available PCIe links in multi-GPU systems for the IO demand of a single target GPU. It routes data through other GPUs to such target GPU that handles IO-intensive analytics tasks. This approach is advantageous when other GPUs are occupied with compute-bound workloads, such as popular AI applications that typically underutilize IO resources. We also introduce a novel programming model that separates GPU kernel development from IO scheduling, reducing programmer burden and enabling GPU code reuse. Additionally, we present the design of certain important query operators and discuss a late materialization technique based on GPU’s zero-copy memory access. Without caching any data in GPU memory,  Vortex  improves the performance of the state-of-the-art GPU baseline, Proteus, by 5.7 × on average and enhances price performance by 2.5 × compared to a CPU-based DuckDB baseline.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of spatial queries is pivotal for the analysis of geometry data in the fields such as computational simulation, point cloud processing and digital engineering. Utilizing the computational capabilities of modern hardware, such as GPUs, offers a promising avenue for accelerating spatial query processing. However, conventional tree-based indexing methods are not optimized for maximal exploitation of GPU resources. \nTo address this problem, we introduce BLAEQ, a multigrid index designed to maximize the potential of GPUs. BLAEQ adopts a multigrid strategy, which represents an index tree with vectors as layers and matrices as connectors. Although BLAEQ shares conceptual similarities with traditional tree-based indexes, its innovative multigrid architecture facilitates effective parallelization on GPUs during the query phase. To optimize GPU utilization, BLAEQ is entirely constructed using BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), leveraging the efficiency of hardware-tuned BLAS libraries like CuBLAS. This design confers BLAEQ with enhanced performance over existing spatial query methods. \nOur study assesses BLAEQ’s performance against state-of-theart spatial query techniques using a range of both real-world and synthetic datasets. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that BLAEQ outperforms the benchmark approaches in terms of query efficiency on geometry data.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) that capture relationships among different types of nodes are ubiquitous in real-world applications such as academic networks and e-commerce. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in learning from these complex structures, distributed training of HGNNs on large-scale graphs with billions of edges faces substantial communication overhead. This challenge is exacerbated by heterogeneous characteristics such as varying feature dimensions across node types and featureless nodes requiring learnable parameters. Existing systems and communication reduction techniques designed for homogeneous graphs become suboptimal or even inapplicable for HetGs and HGNNs by overlooking both these heterogeneous characteristics and the inherent computational structure of HGNNs. We present  Heta , a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training.  Heta  leverages the key insight that HGNN aggregation is order-invariant and decomposable into relation-specific computations. Built on this insight, we introduce three key innovations: (1) a Relation-Aggregation-First (RAF) paradigm that conducts relation-specific aggregations within partitions and exchanges only partial aggregations across machines, proven to reduce communication complexity; (2) a meta-partitioning strategy that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency while minimizing cross-partition communication and maintaining computation and storage balance; and (3) a heterogeneity-aware GPU cache system that accounts for varying miss-penalty ratios across node types. Through extensive evaluation of billion-edge heterogeneous graphs, we demonstrate that Heta  achieves up to 5.3 ×  and 4.4 ×  speedup over state-of-the-art systems DGL and GraphLearn while maintaining model accuracy.",

This demonstration shows Play2Win, an interactive playground that empowers users to explore and compare various windowing strategies under a uni!ed system semantics.

    "title": "SimRN: Trajectory Similarity Learning in Road Networks based on Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Trajectory similarity computation in road networks is crucial for data analytics. However, both non-learning-based and learningbased methods face challenges. First, they suffer from low accuracy due to manual parameter selection for model training and the omission of key spatio-temporal features in road networks. Second, they have low efficiency, stemming from the high time complexity of similarity computation and the time-consuming training process. Third, learning-based methods struggle with poor model generality due to the small size of available training samples. \nTo address these challenges, we propose an effective and efficient trajectory similarity learning framework for road networks, called  SimRN . To our knowledge,  SimRN  is the first deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for trajectory similarity computation. Specifically,  SimRN  consists of three key modules: the spatio-temporal prompt information extraction (STP) module, the trajectory representation based on DRL (TrajRL) module, and the graph contrastive learning (GCL) module. The STP module captures spatio-temporal features from road networks to improve the training of the trajectory representation. The TrajRL module automatically selects optimal parameters and enables parallel training, improving both trajectory representation and the efficiency of similarity computations. The GCL module employs a self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm to generate sufficient samples while preserving spatial constraints and temporal dependencies of trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, compared with three state-of-the-art methods, show that  SimRN : (i) improves accuracy by 20%–40%, (ii) achieves speedups of 2–4x, and (iii) demonstrates strong generality, enabling effective similarity learning with very small sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Open Science is a fundamentally new philosophy about the goals, methods, and business models of scientific research and scholarly communication. The motivation for research remains the same, as Open Science continues to honor scientific curiosity and societal or industrial challenges as its primary drivers. Open Science methodologies, however, continue to spotlight individual researchers for their achievements, but also promote common good. They are motivated by the following needs: increase researchers’ collaboration, accountability, and transparency; democratize researchers’ and the general public’s access to knowledge around the world; reconceive of what constitutes a publication to include data, software, and other artifacts beyond traditional papers; elevate the importance of research results’ reproducibility; and increase society’s trust to the scientific community. Open Science affects every single stage of the research lifecycle significantly. Naturally, the scientific community and the extended ecosystem around it (university administrators, research funders, journal publishers, conference organizers, ...) need ample time to move towards the new mentality.

    "abstract": "The expanding instrumentation of processes throughout society with sensors yields a proliferation of time series data that may in turn enable important applications, e.g., related to trans portation infrastructures or power grids. Machine-learning based  methods are increasingly being used to extract value from such data. We provide means of reducing the resulting considerable computational and data storage costs. We achieve this by providing means of condensing large time series datasets such that models trained on the condensed data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original, large data. Specifically, we propose a   time series   d ataset   c ondensation framework, TimeDC, that employs two-fold modal matching, encompassing frequency matching and training trajectory matching. Thus, TimeDC performs time series feature extraction and decomposition-driven frequency matching to preserve complex temporal dependencies in the reduced time series. Further, TimeDC employs curriculum training trajectory matching to ensure effective and generalized time series dataset condensation. To avoid memory overflow and to reduce the cost of dataset condensation, the framework includes an expert buffer storing pre-computed expert trajectories. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.",

    "abstract": "Graph coarsening techniques aim at simplifying the graph structure while preserving key properties in the resulting coarsened graph, have been widely used in graph partitioning and graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing graph coarsening techniques mainly focus on preserving cuts or graph spectrums. In this paper, we propose a new method that focuses on preserving graph topological features. In particular, we develop a novel graph coarsening approach, called Graph Elementary Collapse (GEC), by extending the concept of elementary collapse in algebraic topology to graph analysis. With this novel method, we can ensure a kind of equivalence relationship called homotopy equivalence of the graph during the coarsening process, thereby preserving numerous topological properties, including connectivity, rings, and voids. To enhance the scalability, we also propose several carefully-designed optimization techniques to reduce the time and memory consumption of our approach. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across various GNN prediction tasks.",

    "title": "Faster Convergence in Mini-batch Graph Neural Networks Training with Pseudo Full Neighborhood Compensation",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-related tasks. However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is hindered by the neighbor explosion problem, rendering full-batch training computationally infeasible. Mini-batch training with neighbor sampling is a widely adopted solution, but it introduces gradient estimation errors that slow convergence and reduce model accuracy. In this work, we identify two primary sources of these errors: (1) missing gradient contributions from unsampled target nodes, and (2) inaccuracies in messages computed from sampled nodes. While existing methods largely focus on mitigating the second source, they often overlook the first, resulting in incomplete gradient estimation. To address this gap, we propose the Pseudo Full Neighborhood Compensation  (PFNC) framework, which leverages historical information to simultaneously compensate for both errors. PFNC is designed to integrate seamlessly with any neighbor sampling technique and significantly lowers memory demands by maintaining only a partial cache of historical embeddings and gradients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that PFNC provides a closer approximation to the ideal gradient, enhancing convergence. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets confirm that PFNC accelerates convergence and improves generalization across diverse neighbor sampling strategies.",

    "title": "FDBKeeper: Enabling Scalable Coordination Services for Metadata Management using Distributed Key-Value Databases",
    "abstract": "High-reliability distributed coordination services have become an indispensable part of modern large-scale distributed systems. Popular coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) adopt a single-writer design to provide a centralized service for managing system metadata, including various conÿguration information and data catalogs, and to provide distributed synchronization functions. With the continuous increase in metadata size and the scale of distributed systems, these coordination services gradually become performance bottlenecks due to their limitations in capacity, read and write performance, and scalability. \nTo bridge the gaps, we propose FDBKeeper, a novel solution that enables scalable coordination services on distributed ACID keyvalue database systems. Our motivation is that transactional keyvalue stores (i.e., FoundationDB) meet the demands of performance and scalability required by large-scale distributed systems over coordination service. To leverage these advantages, coordination services can be implemented as an upper layer on top of distributed ACID key-value databases. Our experimental results demonstrate that FDBKeeper signiÿcantly outperforms ZooKeeper across key metrics. Additionally, FDBKeeper reduces hardware resource costs on average by 33% in the production environment, resulting in substantial monetary cost savings. We have successfully replaced ZooKeeper with FDBKeeper in the production-grade ClickHouse cluster deployment.",

    "abstract": "While existing spatiotemporal prediction models have shown promising performance, they often rely on the assumption of input-label spatiotemporal consistency, and their high complexity raises concerns about scalability. To enhance both efficiency and performance, we integrate label information into the learning process and propose a spatiotemporal dynamic theory that outlines a bi-directional learning paradigm. Building on this paradigm, we design BiST, a lightweight yet effective  Bi -directional  S patio- T emporal prediction model. BiST incorporates two key processes: a forward spatiotemporal learning process and a backward correction process. The forward process utilizes MLP layers exclusively to model input correlations and generate base prediction. In the backward process, we implement a spatiotemporal decoupling module, which can learn the residual modeling deviation between input and label representations from a decoupled perspective. After smoothing the residual with a diffusion module, we can obtain the correction term to correct the base predictions. This innovative design enables BiST to achieve competitive performance while remaining lightweight. We evaluate BiST against 26 baselines across 13 datasets, including a large-scale dataset with ten thousand nodes and a longrange dataset spanning 20 years. An impressive experimental result demonstrates that BiST achieves a 8.13% improvement in performance compared to state-of-the-art models while consuming only 1.86% of the training time and 7.36% of the memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses. However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries, lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings. This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual matching. Evaluation of realworld conversations shows that ContextCache improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally, cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM conversational applications.",

    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is essential for optimizing query execution plans. Recent ML-based CardEst methods achieve high accuracy but face deployment challenges due to high preparation costs and lack of transferability across databases. In this paper, we propose  PRICE , a   PR etrained mul t I -table   C ard E st model, which addresses these limitations.  PRICE  takes low-level but transferable features w.r.t. data distributions and query information and ele-features w.r.t. data distributions and query information and elegantly applies self-attention models to learn meta-knowledge to compute cardinality in any database. It is generally and adaptively applicable to any unseen new database to attain high estimation accuracy, while its preparation cost is as little as the basic one-accuracy, while its preparation cost is as little as the basic onedimensional histogram-based CardEst methods. Moreover,  PRICE can be finetuned to further enhance its performance on any specific database. We pretrained  PRICE  using 30 diverse datasets, com-database. We pretrained  PRICE  using 30 diverse datasets, completing the process in about 5 hours with a resulting model size of only about 40MB.

After finetuning with a small volume of database-specific queries,  PRICE  could even find plans that were very close to the optimal ones. Meanwhile,  PRICE  is generally applicable to different settings such as data updates, data scaling, and query workload shifts.",

    "abstract": "Real-world datasets often suﬀer from multiple quality issues, hindering downstream model performance and increasing cleaning costs. To address this, we propose  DemandClean , a reinforcement learning-based adaptive data cleaning framework that dynamically balances cleaning eﬀectiveness and operational costs.  DemandClean explicitly considers data authenticity (alignment with real-world facts), diversity (richness of feature values), and downstream models’ noise tolerance. We categorize data errors as missing (reducing authenticity and diversity), semantic (aﬀecting only authenticity), and syntactic (aﬀecting authenticity but potentially increasing diversity). Based on these errors,  DemandClean  intelligently selects among Repair, Delete, or No actions, guided by error rates and model robustness. For interpretability, the framework visually distinguishes authenticity, diversity, and tolerance. Extensive experiments conﬁrm that  DemandClean  achieves near-optimal accuracy at substantially reduced preprocessing costs. Speciﬁcally, it reduces repair actions by 80.0% and deletions by 80.7% compared to “Repair All” strategies, while maintaining or even exceeding their predictive performance, thus oﬀering an interpretable, cost-eﬀective, and scalable solution for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Many graph processing applications consist of read-only workloads that need to perform low-latency traversals over large graphs. These traversals are inherently expensive, and storage and processing systems need to be optimized for them. The performance of secondary storage-based systems can be improved by caching locality-driven data in memory. Exploring the data reuse of graph objects in applications is important to decrease the page faults in the cache. However, graph applications can suffer from poor access locality, making caching of graph data challenging. Locality can be imposed through graph ordering algorithms that can be exploited by cache replacement algorithms. We propose a graph locality-aware cache replacement policy called LAC that exploits the serialization layout obtained by graph ordering techniques. We show that the spatial locality that is captured on disk pages offers temporal locality for subsequent accesses of cache pages, and this information can be used to make improved cache replacement decisions. We evaluate LAC against the popular GCLOCK algorithm for input graphs with different structural properties while running various query types. Our evaluation shows that LAC can outperform GCLOCK through page fault improvements by reducing latency up to 1.42 ×  in simulation studies and up to 1.23 ×  with integration into the Neo4j system.",

Given a forecasting task, which includes a dataset and a forecasting horizon, automated design methods automatically search for an optimal forecasting model for the task in a manually designed search space, and then train the identified model using the dataset to enable the forecasting. Existing automated methods face three challenges. First, the search space is constructed by human experts, rending the methods only semi-automated and yielding search spaces prone to subjective biases. Second, it is time consuming to search for an optimal model. Third, training the identified model for a new task is also costly. These challenges limit the practicability of automated methods in real-world settings. To contend with the challenges, we propose a fully automated and highly efficient correlated time series forecasting framework where the search and training can be done in minutes.

    "title": "Efficient Graph Embedding Generation and Update for Large-Scale Temporal Graph",
    "abstract": "Graph embedding aims at mapping each node to a low-dimensional vector, beneﬁcial for various applications like pattern matching, retrieval augmented generation and recommendation. In this paper, we study the large-scale temporal graph embedding problem. Diﬀerent from simple graphs, each edge has a timestamp in temporal graphs, which requires the embeddings to encode the temporal biases. Factorizing similarity matrix is a common approach for generating simple graph embeddings where similarity can be well characterized by some conventional metrics like personalized PageRank. However, how to construct a similarity that can encode interactions with temporal biases is a critical problem for large scale temporal graphs. To address this, we introduce the concept of temporal-based bipartite graph (TBG) and develop the temporal preferential attachment similarity (TPASim) that reﬂects concurrent node activity over time. Directly factorizing the TPASim matrix, which contains nearly  n2   non-zeros, is not feasible for large graphs with  n nodes. Instead, we present  LTGE , which constructs and factorizes a temporal matrix with at most  2m non-zeros, where  m is the number of edges. Our theoretical analysis shows that  LTGE achieves the same embeddings as factorizing the TPASim matrix but signiﬁcantly reduces complexity by a factor of n2/m. On the other hand, when graphs evolve over time, to avoid recomputing, we further propose  LTGEInc  that utilizes a novel incremental singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm with provable guarantee for updating the embeddings. Extensive experiments on several datasets with up to 17 million nodes and 1.3 billion edges demonstrate that  LTGE  outperforms the state of the art signiﬁcantly and is orders of magnitude faster than the baselines specially designed for temporal graphs. For embeddings update,  LTGEInc  retains the performance with small computational overhead.",

As a fundamental topic in HIN min- ing, community mining has found various real applications, such as recommendation, biological data analysis, and event organization. Most existing works often rely on meta-paths, relational constraints, spectral partitioning, label propagation, and network representa- tion to define the communities. However, almost all these works do not explicitly consider the structural similarity between vertices, which plays a vital role in modeling communities and also ignore the specific roles of vertices. In this paper, we propose a novel com- munity model, called structurally similar community (SSC), which models the HIN communities by explicitly considering the struc- tural similarity between vertices. In particular, SSC can not only support various structural similarity measures, but also identify different roles of the vertices in the community, such as cores, non- cores, hubs, and outliers. Based on the SSC, we develop fast online and index-based algorithms that support both efficient searching and detecting SSCs in large HINs, where the former one searches an SSC containing a specific query vertex while the latter one detects all the SSCs from the HIN. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SSC model in revealing meaningful communities and the high efficiency of our proposed algorithms.",

The tutorial explores the challenges of integrating vector search into database engines and emphasizes the need for new optimization techniques. It explains the three primary filtered search methods for fvs queries over generic tree-based and graph-based indices and examines the factors influencing the selection of the most efficient method. A key objective is to highlight the importance of achieving stable recall, ideally in a declarative manner, ensuring consistent recall across queries.

    "title": "GraphCSR: A Degree-Equalized CSR Format for Large-scale Graph Processing",
    "abstract": "Graph processing underpins a vast array of data-centric applications, serving as a crucial component in fields such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, bio-informatics, and search engines. As graph data grows in scale and complexity, highperformance graph processing is increasingly essential. Many graph processing tasks depend on efficient data structures to manage the sparsity typical of real-world graphs, where most vertices have limited connectivity. This sparsity poses challenges for memory and computational efficiency in large-scale graph processing, and conventional sparse formats like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) often struggle with memory and computation inefficiencies when handling massive graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphCSR, a degree-equalized CSR format specifically tailored to enhance the spatio-temporal efficiency of distributed graph processing across various tasks. GraphCSR aggregates low-degree vertices into synthetic high-degree ones and applies group-wise compression to reduce storage overhead by recording only the starting index for each aggregated group. This reduces memory usage and supports batch-memory access to improve performance. Our extensive evaluations in various graph processing algorithms and datasets demonstrate that GraphCSR not only reduces the memory footprint required for large-scale graphs, but also improves performance across multiple types of graph processing tasks, outperforming popular sparse storage formats. Furthermore, when deployed on a production-scale supercomputer with 79,024 nodes, GraphCSR achieved a graph processing throughput that exceeded the top-ranked system on the Graph500 benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Top-𝑘 Nearest Neighbors (𝑘NN) problem on road network has numerous applications on location-based services. As direct search using the Dijkstra’s algorithm results in a large search space, a plethora of complex-index-based approaches have been proposed to speedup the query processing. However, even with the current state-of-the-art approach, long query processing delays persist, along with significant space overhead and prohibitively long indexing time. In this paper, we depart from the complex index designs prevalent in existing literature and propose a simple index named KNN-Index. With KNN-Index, we can answer a 𝑘NN query optimally and progressively with small and size-bounded index. To improve the index construction performance, we propose a bidirectional construction algorithm which can effectively share the common computation during the construction. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real road networks demonstrate the superiority of KNN-Index over the state-of-the-art approach in query processing performance, index size, and index construction efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Conjunctive queries (CQs) have been widely used in database systems in which acyclic CQs can be computed efficiently, whereas cyclic CQs may not. Here, a CQ is acyclic if its hypergraph representation H is acyclic. In order to find a class of CQs that are “mildly cyclic”, hypertree decompositions (HDs) have been studied. The quality of such HDs is by the so-called hypertree width. The class of acyclic queries is the queries whose hypertree width is 1, and a mildly cyclic CQ can be processed efficiently if its hypertree width is bounded. There are several HDs, such as tree decomposition (TD), generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD), fractional hypertree decomposition (FHD), as well as hypertree decomposition (HD). The minimum hypertree width by FHD is the smallest among all, and it is NP-complete to check if the minimum hypertree width by FHD exists for a given hypertree width at most 𝑘. In the literature, there is no dynamic programming (DP) algorithm or branch-&-bound algorithm reported to compute FHD. In this paper, we show that there is a DP algorithm for FHD, and we give a branch-&-bound algorithm based on our DP algorithm to compute FHD with upper/lower bounds. We confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm by testing all 3,648 hypergraphs given in a benchmark for HDs, and we also confirm our approach in query evaluation in real database systems.",

    "title": "Federated Incomplete Tabular Data Prediction with Missing Complementarity",
    "abstract": "Tabular data is abundant and crucial across both industry and academia. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for the analysis of tabular data distributed across multiple organizations, without the need to share the privacy information of each client. Existing federated tabular data prediction methods optimize performance and privacy leakage under the completeness assumption of tabular data. They are not applicable in real-world scenarios that are struggling with missing values in tabular data. In this paper, we propose a novel federated prediction framework for incomplete tabular data, named  DARN , which leverages the  missing complementarity  to directly optimize prediction performance without relying on the imputed values. It is especially beneficial when clients exhibit heterogeneity in missing data distributions, and the pairwise observed data are complementary. Specifically, each client trains a  missing distribution learning model  to capture the distribution of locally incomplete data. To assist in this, we present a missing-aware transformer block  with a novel missing-aware attention mechanism to represent incomplete tabular data directly. The server calculates the personalized weights of the prediction models by combining  missing complementary score  and  observed sample size score , thereby maximizing the utility of the available data. Extensive experiments on four publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that  DARN  outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 25.80% improvement in both classification and regression tasks.",

    "abstract": "A k-plex is a dense subgraph structure where every vertex can be disconnected with at most k vertices. Finding a maximum  k-plex (MkP) in a big graph is a key primitive in many real applicati ons such as community detection and biological network analysis. A lot of MkP algorithms have been actively proposed in recent years in top AI and DB conferences, featuring a broad range of sophisticated pruning techniques. In this paper, we study the various pruning techniques from nine recent MkP algorithms including kPlexT, Maple, Seesaw, DiseMKP, kPlexS, KpLeX, Maplex, BnB and BS by unifying them in a common framework called U-MkP. We summarize their proposed techniques into three categories, those for (1) branching, (2) upper bounding, and (3) reduction during subgraph exploration. We ﬁnd that different pruning techniques can have drastically different performance impacts, but there exists a conﬁguration of the techniques dependent on  k that leads to the best performance in vast majority of the time. Interestingly, extensive experiments with our uniﬁed framework reveal that some techniques are not effective as claimed in the original works, and we also discover an unmentioned technique that is actually the major performance booster when  k  >  5 . We also study problem variants such as ﬁnding all the MkPs and ﬁnding the densest MkP (i.e., with the most edges) to cover community diversity, and effective algorithm parallelization.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent focus on time-series anomaly detection, the eﬀectiveness of the proposed anomaly detectors is restricted to speciﬁc domains. A model that performs well on one dataset may not perform well on another. Therefore, how to develop automated solutions for anomaly detection for a particular dataset has emerged as a pressing issue. However, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding providing a comprehensive review of the ongoing eﬀorts toward automated solutions for selecting or generating scores in an automated manner. Conducting a meta-analysis of proposed methods is challenging due to: (i) their evaluation across limited datasets; (ii) diﬀerent assumptions on application scenarios; and (iii) the absence of evaluations for out-of-distribution performance. Motivated by the limitations above, we introduce the EasyAD, a modular web engine designed to facilitate the exploration of the ﬁrst comprehensive benchmark for automated time-series anomaly detection. The EasyAD engine enables rigorous statistical analysis of 20 automated methods and 70 of their variants across the TSB-AD benchmark, a recently curated, heterogeneous dataset spanning nine application domains. The engine supports a two-dimensional evaluation framework, incorporating both accuracy and runtime performance. Our engine allows users to assess the performance of various methods per dataset and per instance, which oﬀers ﬁne-grained analysis per time series. Furthermore, the engine accommodates the processing of user-uploaded data, enabling users to experiment with diﬀerent model selection strategies on their own datasets.",

    "title": "Beyond Shortest Paths: Node Fairness in Route Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, route recommendation systems focused on minimizing distance (or time) to travel between two points. However, recent attention has shifted to other factors beyond mere length. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring a fair distribution of visits among network nodes when handling a high volume of point-topoint path queries. In doing so, we adopt a  Rawlsian  notion of individual-level fairness exploiting the power of randomization. Specifically, we aim to create a probabilistic distribution over paths that maximizes the minimum probability of any eligible node being included in the recommended path. \nA key idea of our work is the notion of  forward paths , i.e., paths where travelling along any edge decreases the distance to the destination. In unweighted graphs forward paths and shortest paths coincide, but in weighted graphs forward paths provide a richer set of alternative routes, involving many more nodes while remaining close in length to the shortest path. Thus, they offer diversity and a wider basis for fairness, while maintaining near-optimal path lengths. We devise an algorithm that extracts a directed acyclic graph (DAG) containing all the forward paths in the input graph, with the same computational runtime as solving a single shortestpath query. This avoids enumerating all possible forward paths, which can be exponential in the number of nodes. We then design a flow problem on this DAG to derive the probabilistic distribution over forward paths with the desired fairness property, solvable in polynomial time through a sequence of small linear programs. \nOur experiments on real-world datasets validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that our technique provides individual node satisfaction while maintaining near-optimal path lengths. Moreover, our experiments show that our method can handle networks with millions of nodes and edges on a commodity laptop, and scales better than the baselines when there is a large volume of path queries for the same source and destination pair.",

    "title": "STsCache: An Efficient Semantic Caching Scheme for Time-series Data Workloads Based on Hybrid Storage",
    "abstract": "Due to the increasing demand for extreme-scale time-series data workloads in data centers, it is required to build a high-performance semantic caching system that leverages the semantics and results of historical queries to answer time-series queries. Existing caching solutions either ignore the semantics of queries, offering suboptimal performance, or focus only on specific scenarios, providing smallcapacity, limited functionality. \nIn this paper, we summarize the query patterns of time-series data workload and propose the definition of semantic time-series caching for the first time. Accordingly, we present a semantic timeseries caching system, STsCache, based on a hybrid storage model with memory and NVMe SSD. We propose a series of optimized strategies, such as slab-based semantic data management, semantic index, semantic value-driven batch eviction, time-aware deduplication insertion, and lazy compaction. We implemented and evaluated STsCache via benchmarks and production environments. STsCache can increase throughput of popular time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) by 4.8-10.8 ×  and reduce latency by 79.9%-93.5%. Compared with the latest time-series caching schemes (TSCache, BSCache), STsCache can increase throughput by 1.5-4.5 × , reduce latency by 59.4%-81.9%, and increase hit ratios by 22.5%-82.4%.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new graph sparsification method that targets the neighborhood information available for each node. Our approach is motivated by the fact that neighborhood information is used by several mining and learning tasks on graphs as well as reachability queries. The result of our sparsification technique is a sparsified graph that can be used instead of the original graph in the above tasks while still ensuring fairly good approximations for the results. Moreover, our sparsification method allows users to control the size of the resulting sparsified graph by adjusting the amount of information loss tolerated by the targeted applications. Our extensive experiments conducted on various real and synthetic graphs show that our sparsification considerably reduces the size of the graphs by achieving 40% sparsification rate on average on several input graphs. Furthermore, in the experimental study we show the utility and efficiency of our sparsification algorithm for notable data-driven tasks, such as node classification, graph classification and shortest path approximations.",

    "abstract": "Explaining the results of clustering pipelines by unraveling the characteristics of each cluster is a challenging task, often addressed manually through visualizations and queries. Existing solutions from the domain of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are largely ineffective for cluster explanations, and interpretable-by- design clustering algorithms may be unsuitable when the clustering algorithm does not fit the data properties.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Cluster-Explorer, a novel explainability tool for black-box clustering pipelines. Our approach formulates the explanation of clusters as the identification of con- cise conjunctions of predicates that maximize the coverage of the cluster’s data points while minimizing separation from other clusters. We achieve this by reducing the problem to generalized frequent-itemsets mining (gFIM), where items correspond to ex- planation predicates, and itemset frequency indicates coverage. To enhance efficiency, we leverage inherent problem properties and implement attribute selection to further reduce computational costs. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark collection of 98 cluster- ing results demonstrate the superiority of Cluster-Explorer in both explanation quality and execution times compared to XAI baselines.",

    "abstract": "We study the subgraph matching problem, which is to ﬁnd all subgraph isomorphisms of a given pattern graph  Ħ  in a data graph ă . Traditional approaches typically use a backtracking search approach or worst-case optimal join, both of which directly operate on  Ħ . In this paper, we revisit the tree decomposition based approach. For a complex pattern graph  Ħ , we ﬁnd its optimal tree decomposition  Đ  based on the fractional hypertree width, where a node in  Đ  represents a subgraph of  Ħ , which is also called a bag, and a node in  Ħ  may appear in multiple bags in  Đ . The tree decomposition based approach initially computes and materializes the matches of subgraphs speciﬁed by the bags, then treats these matches as new relations and employs an acyclic join to compute the matches of  Ħ  itself. However, previous approaches fail to integrate the tree decomposition with eﬀective join attribute orders, and conversely, previous join attribute ordering approaches do not consider the need to share computations in multiple bags. Additionally, the materialization strategies in previous tree decomposition based approaches can lead to high computation costs. In this paper, we propose a new subgraph matching algorithm  ASDMatch ( A daptive   S hared   D ecomposition-based matching). We propose a new dynamic programming approach that ﬁnds optimal attribute orders for each bag based on a cost model that incorporates the computation sharing. Furthermore, we introduce a new adaptive materialization strategy to reduce the computation cost. We conﬁrmed that our  ASDMatch  outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and can process many challenging queries that previous algorithms can not ﬁnish within the time limit.",

Our work is novel in two ways (i) we model realistic and socially-salient missingness scenarios that go beyond Rubin’s classic Missing Completely at Random ( MCAR ), Missing At Random ( MAR ) and Missing Not At Random ( MNAR ) settings, to include multi-mechanism missingness (when different missingness patterns co-exist in the data) and missingness shift (when the missingness mechanism changes between training and test) (ii) we evaluate imputers holistically, based on imputation quality and imputation fairness, as well as on the predictive performance, fairness and stability of the models that are trained and tested on the data post-imputation. \nWe use  Shades-of-Null  to conduct a large-scale empirical study involving 29,736 experimental pipelines, and find that while there is no single best-performing imputation approach for all missingness types, interesting trade-offs arise between predictive performance, fairness and stability, based on the combination of missingness scenario, imputer choice, and the architecture of the predictive model.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new open-source big data ﬁle format, called FastLanes. It is designed for modern data-parallel execution (SIMD or GPU), and evolves the features of previous data formats such as Parquet, which are the foundation of data lakes, and which increasingly are used in AI pipelines. It does so by avoiding generic compression methods (e.g. Snappy) in favor of lightweight encodings, that are fully data-parallel. To enhance compression ratio, it cascades encodings using a ﬂexible  expression encoding  mechanism. This mechanism also enables multi-column compression (MCC), enhancing compression by exploiting correlations between columns, a long-time weakness of columnar storage. We contribute a 2-phase algorithm to ﬁnd encodings expressions during compression. \nFastLanes also innovates in its API, providing ﬂexible support for  partial  decompression, facilitating engines to execute queries on compressed data. FastLanes is designed for ﬁne-grained access, at the level of small batches rather than rowgroups; in order to limit the decompression memory footprint to ﬁt CPU and GPU caches. \nWe contribute an open-source implementation of FastLanes in portable (auto-vectorizing) C++. Our evaluation on a corpus of real-world data shows that FastLanes improves compression ratio over Parquet, while strongly accelerating decompression, making it a win-win over the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "In the era of big data, the landscape of data management and analytics has signiﬁcantly transformed, presenting diverse challenges for cloud platforms. Modern data warehouses face increasing challenges in handling hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads eﬃciently in cloud environments. Traditional shared-nothing architectures provide high-performance query execution but suﬀer from high storage costs and limited elasticity, while shared-storage approaches improve scalability but often struggle with query eﬃciency due to increased data movement and indexing overhead. Furthermore, existing execution engines lack optimized support for vectorized processing and real-time analytics, limiting their ability to handle large-scale workloads eﬃciently. \nTo address these limitations, we introduce AnalyticDB-PG (ADBPG), a cloud-native, high-performance data warehouse designed for modern analytical workloads. It integrates a uniﬁed architecture supporting both Shared-Nothing and Shared-Storage modes, allowing ﬂexible deployment and seamless elasticity. In ADB-PG, we introduce Beam, a hybrid storage engine that eﬃciently balances row-based and columnar storage for real-time analytics, and Laser, an optimized execution engine leveraging vectorized execution and Just-In-Time compilation to accelerate query processing. The system further incorporates advanced indexing mechanisms, adaptive runtime ﬁltering, and dictionary encoding to enhance performance. Extensive evaluations on TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks demonstrate that ADB-PG achieves signiﬁcant performance improvements while reducing storage and operational costs, making it a compelling solution for modern cloud-based data analytics.",

In this work, we introduce the first method for semantic conformance testing of RDBMSs. Our contributions are threefold.

Secondly, we propose three coverage criteria based on these formal semantics, along with a coverage-guided query generation algorithm that effect-with a coverage-guided query generation algorithm that effectively generates queries achieving high semantic coverage. Lastly, we apply our approach to six widely-used and thoroughly tested RDBMSs, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL and OceanBase, uncovering 19 bugs and 13 inconsistencies, all of which are confirmed by RDBMS developers.",

    "title": "Falcon: Advancing Asynchronous BFT Consensus for Lower Latency and Enhanced Throughput",
    "abstract": "Asynchronous  Byzantine Fault Tolerant  (BFT) consensus protocols have garnered significant attention with the rise of blockchain technology. A typical asynchronous protocol is designed by executing sequential instances of the  Asynchronous Common Sub-seQuence (ACSQ). The ACSQ protocol consists of two primary components: the  Asynchronous Common Subset  (ACS) protocol and a block sorting mechanism, with the ACS protocol comprising two stages: broadcast and agreement. However, current protocols encounter three critical issues: high latency arising from the execution of the agreement stage, latency instability due to the integral-sorting mechanism, and reduced throughput caused by block discarding. \nTo address these issues, we propose Falcon, an asynchronous BFT protocol that achieves low latency and enhanced throughput. Falcon introduces a novel broadcast protocol,  Graded Broadcast  (GBC), which enables a block to be included in the  ACS  set directly, bypassing the agreement stage and thereby reducing latency. To ensure safety, Falcon incorporates a new binary agreement protocol called Asymmetrical Asynchronous Binary Agreement  (AABA), designed to complement GBC. Additionally, Falcon employs a partial-sorting mechanism, allowing continuous rather than simultaneous block committing, enhancing latency stability. Finally, we incorporate an agreement trigger that, before its activation, enables nodes to wait for more blocks to be delivered and committed, thereby boosting throughput. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate Falcon, demonstrating its superior performance.",

    "abstract": "Denial constraints (DCs) are well-known to express business rules on data. They subsume other integrity constraints ( IC s), such as key constraints or functional dependencies. One can use traditional DBMS or specialized algorithms to validate such dependencies on a dataset. However, no known approach exists to detect DC violations incrementally . Data typically changes over time, and recomputing the entire violation set after every update is wasteful. Alerting data practitioners of data quality issues immediately, enables them to take measures earlier and can help prevent follow-up issues. \nWe present Weever, the first incremental approach to detect all violations of a given set of DCs. It uses a novel index structure to process inequality predicates and a new method to plan the execution order of predicates depending on their selectivity, reducing redundant computations when handling multiple DCs. Our evaluation shows that Weever outperforms a DBMS-based baseline by up to two orders of magnitude. And in the same time that a state-of-the-art static approach takes to analyze an entire dataset, Weever processes up to 200 000 insertions.",

    "title": "VSAG: An Optimized Search Framework for Graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search",
    "abstract": "Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graphbased ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index. This paper introduces  VSAG , an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG  has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations:  (i) efficient memory access : it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization;  (ii) automated parameter tuning : it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding;  (iii) efficient distance computation : it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate  VSAG  on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that  VSAG  achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4 ×  speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Graph-theoretic algorithms and graph machine learning models are essential tools for addressing many real-life problems, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. To support largescale graph analytics, graph-parallel systems have been actively developed for over one decade, such as Google’s Pregel and Spark’s GraphX, which (i) promote a think-like-a-vertex computing model and target (ii) iterative algorithms and (iii) those problems that output a value for each vertex. However, this model is too restricted for supporting the rich set of heterogeneous operations for graph analytics and machine learning that many real applications demand. \nIn recent years, two new trends emerge in graph-parallel systems research: (1) a novel think-like-a-task computing model that can efficiently support the various computationally expensive problems of subgraph search; and (2) scalable systems for learning graph neural networks. These systems effectively complement the diversity needs of graph-parallel tools that can flexibly work together in a comprehensive graph processing pipeline for real applications, with the capability of capturing structural features. This tutorial will provide an effective categorization of the recent systems in these two directions based on their computing models and adopted techniques, and will review the key design ideas of these systems.

    "abstract": "Modern data-intensive applications require databases that support fast analytical processing on massive dynamic graphs in real time, while simultaneously providing transactional guarantees for modi- fying graph-based objects (i.e., edges, vertices and their properties). Achieving efficient Hybrid Graph Transactional/Analytical Pro- cessing (HGTAP) in a database poses significant challenges due to the simultaneous requirements of high operation throughput, high data freshness, and high performance isolation when processing concurrent read/write queries on intricate graph topology. Existing disk-based graph databases fail to meet these requirements at the same time due to their inclined data layout, such as the transac- tional storage based on adjacency list and the analytical storage based on CSR (compressed sparse row) format.\nTo address these challenges, we present BACH (Bridging Adja- cency List and CSR Format using LSM (Log-Structured Merge)- Trees for HGTAP Workloads) to fill the gaps in HGTAP databases. BACH expands the design space of traditional LSM-Trees to ac- commodate different graph data layouts in different levels. The compaction process is further extended to seamlessly transform the graph layout from the TP-friendly adjacency list to the AP- friendly CSR format through the data propagation to deeper levels in the LSM-Tree. A novel compaction policy, namely elastic merge, is carefully devised to adapt to diverse workloads and the skew vertex degree distribution on graph data. These techniques lead to a Graph-aware Real-time (GR)-LSM-Tree, which can provide consis- tently efficient data access for diverse workloads throughout the entire lifespan of graph objects. Then, a lightweight multi-version scheme is devised for the GR-LSM-Tree to accelerate the concur- rent read/write processing with the snap-shot isolation guarantee. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BACH significantly outperforms other disk-based graph database solutions in HGTAP workloads.",

    "title": "SagaLLM: Context Management, Validation, and Transaction Guarantees for Multi-Agent LLM Planning",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent architecture designed to address four foundational limitations of current LLM-based planning systems: unreliable self-validation, context loss, lack of transactional safeguards, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. While recent frameworks leverage LLMs for task decomposition and multi-agent communication, they often fail to ensure consistency, rollback, or constraint satisfaction across distributed workflows. SagaLLM bridges this gap by integrating the Saga transactional pattern with persistent memory, automated compensation, and independent validation agents. It leverages LLMs’ generative reasoning to automate key tasks traditionally requiring hand-coded coordination logic, including state tracking, dependency analysis, log schema generation, and recovery orchestration. Although SagaLLM relaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and recovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical evaluations across planning domains demonstrate that standalone LLMs frequently violate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions. In contrast, SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency, validation accuracy, and adaptive coordination under uncertainty—establishing a robust foundation for real-world, scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems.",

We consider  RFDs  that relax restrictions in both value equality and constraint satisfaction: treating values as equal if their distance is less than a given similarity threshold, and considering  RFDs  with violations below a given error threshold as valid. As a highly non-trivial extension of the row-based approach to functional dependency ( FD ) discovery, we present the first algorithm capable of discovering all valid and minimal  RFDs . We extend the structure called “ difference-set ” for  predicates  that are combinations of attributes and similarity thresholds. We present an efficient method for difference-set construction, incorporating optimizations for both time and space complexity. When inferring  RFDs  from difference-sets, we enumerate  RFDs  based on the subsumption relationship of their right-hand-side predicates to share computations. An extensive experimental evaluation verifies that the proposed discovery algorithm is faster than baseline methods up to orders of magnitude and effective in finding hidden  FDs  from dirty data.",

    "title": "Stochastic SketchRefine: Scaling In-Database Decision-Making under Uncertainty to Millions of Tuples",
    "abstract": "Decision making under uncertainty often requires choosing  packages , or bags of tuples, that collectively optimize expected outcomes while limiting risks. Processing  Stochastic Package Queries  (SPQs) involves solving very large optimization problems on uncertain data. Monte Carlo methods create numerous  scenarios , or sample realizations of the stochastic attributes of  all  the tuples, and generate packages with optimal objective values across these scenarios. The number of scenarios needed for accurate approximation—and hence the size of the optimization problem when using prior methods— increases with variance in the data, and the search space of the optimization problem increases exponentially with the number of tuples in the relation. Existing solvers take hours to process SPQs on large relations containing stochastic attributes with high variance. Besides enriching the SPaQL language to capture a broader class of risk specifications, we make two fundamental contributions toward scalable SPQ processing. First, we propose  risk-constraint linearization  (RCL), which converts SPQs into Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) whose size is independent of the number of scenarios used. Solving these ILPs gives us feasible and near-optimal packages. Second, we propose Stochastic SketchRefine, a divide and conquer framework that breaks down a large stochastic optimization problem into subproblems involving smaller subsets of tuples. Our experiments show that, together, RCL and Stochastic SketchRefine produce high-quality packages in orders of magnitude lower runtime than the state of the art.",

Recent proposals o!er declarative frameworks for LLMpowered processing of unstructured data, but they typically execute user-specified operations as-is in a single LLM call—focusing on cost rather than accuracy. This is problematic for complex tasks, where even well-prompted LLMs can miss relevant information. For instance, reliably extracting  all  instances of a specific clause from legal documents often requires decomposing the task, the data, or both. \nWe present DocETL, a system that optimizes complex document processing pipelines, while accounting for LLM shortcomings. DocETL offers a declarative interface for users to define such pipelines and uses an agent-based approach to automatically optimize them, leveraging novel agent-based rewrites (that we call  rewrite directives ), as well as an optimization and evaluation framework. We introduce  (i)  logical rewriting of pipelines, tailored for LLM-based tasks,  (ii)  an agent-guided plan evaluation mechanism, and  (iii) an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds promising plans, considering the latencies of LLM execution. Across four real-world document processing tasks, DocETL improves accuracy by 21–80% over strong baselines. DocETL is open-source at  docetl.org  and, as of March 2025, has over 1.7k GitHub stars across diverse domains.",

    "abstract": "Due to a variety of reasons, such as privacy, data in the wild often misses the grouping information required for identifying minori- ties. On the other hand, it is known that machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on and, hence, may underperform for the under-represented minority groups. The miss- ing grouping information presents a dilemma for responsible data scientists who find themselves in an unknown-unknown situation, where not only do they not have access to the grouping attributes but do not also know what groups to consider.\nThis paper is an attempt to address this dilemma. Specifically, we propose a minority mining problem, where we find vectors in the attribute space that reveal potential groups that are under-represented and under-performing. Technically speaking, we propose a geometric transformation of data into a dual space and use notions such as the arrangement of hyperplanes to design an efficient algorithm for the problem in lower dimensions. Generalizing our solution to the higher dimensions is cursed by dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a solution based on smart exploration of the search space for such cases. We conduct comprehensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets alongside the theoretical analysis. Our experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro- posed solutions in mining the unknown, under-represented, and under-performing minorities.",

    "abstract": "Unstructured data comprises over 80% of today’s information, yet no specialized system effectively supports its semantic analytics. Traditional SQL-based approaches rely on predefined schemas, making them unsuitable. While large language models (LLMs) enable semantic analysis of unstructured data, manually orchestrating execution plans remains inefficient. This raises a critical question: how can we automate unstructured data analytics?  In this demonstration, we present  Unify , a system that automates unstructured data analytics for natural language queries.  Unify  defines a set of core operators for unstructured data processing, with both preprogrammed and LLM-based implementations. It guides LLMs to decompose queries into logical steps and map them to appropriate operators for accurate execution. Our demonstration showcases Unify  by real-world scenarios, highlighting its ability to bridge the gap between unstructured data and actionable analytics.",

For the parallelization, the engines evenly partition the tuples in a table that will be scanned by the pipeline’s first operator (a scan), and each thread executes the pipeline for the tuples in a partition. However, this approach leads to load imbalances since an operator returns a varying number of output tuples per input tuple, particularly under non-uniform data distributions such as skewed join key val-under non-uniform data distributions such as skewed join key values. The load imbalances are classified into  intra- and inter-warp load imbalances  (intra-WLIs and inter-WLIs) since 1) threads are grouped into warps and 2) every thread in a warp evaluates the same operator for an input tuple concurrently following a  single-same operator for an input tuple concurrently following a  singleinstruction-multiple-thread  manner. In contrast, threads in different warps can evaluate different operators concurrently. Although load balancing techniques have been proposed, however, they fail to solve the load imbalances on various workloads.

First, Themis minimizes intra-WLIs by redistributing tuples between the threads in a warp and making the threads evaluate an operator only when all of them hold inputs. Second, Themis mitigates the inter-WLIs by redistributing the tuples of warps with heavy workloads to idle warps. To check whether a warp’s work-heavy workloads to idle warps. To check whether a warp’s workload is heavy, we propose a method to approximate the sizes of warps’ workloads. Based on these approximations, Themis adap-warps’ workloads. Based on these approximations, Themis adaptively adjusts the threshold for determining a warp’s workload as heavy. In a recent benchmark JCC-H, which introduces skewed join key distributions to TPC-H, Themis significantly alleviates the inter-WLIs and intra-WLIs, outperforming the runner-up by up to 379x.",

    "abstract": "The graph edit distance (GED) is among the most widely used graph similarity measures in practice. It asks for a minimum cost edit path between two given labeled graphs  𝐺 and  𝐻 , where the edit path is defined as a sequence of operations (e.g., node and edge insertions, deletions or substitutions) that successively transform the graph  𝐺 into  𝐻 . \nIn this work, we suggest a new ILP formulation (FORI) based on orienting the corresponding edge variables. Moreover, we suggest enhancing two state-of-the-art ILP formulations by incorporating additional inequalities. We theoretically compare the strength of the formulations with respect to their Linear Programming relaxations. The result is a hierarchy with (FORI) at the top. \nOur extensive evaluation on widely used benchmark sets shows that our improved formulations run significantly faster than the previous ones. These allow to solve to proven optimality all the reference instances from common databases, such as the IAM Graph Database, many of which were prohibitive with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we are able to compute the GED of a small pattern and a large graph such as CORA and PUBMED, having up to 19,717 nodes and 44,327 edges.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, when the code of a database management system (DBMS) needs to be updated, the system is restarted, and database clients suffer downtime, or the provider instantiates hot-standby instances and rolls over the workload. We investigate a third option, live patching of the DBMS binary. For certain code changes, live patching allows to modify the application code in memory, without restart. The memory state and all client connections can be maintained. Although live patching has been explored in the operating systems research community, it remains a blind spot in DBMS research. In this Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark article, we systematically explore this field from the DBMS perspective. We discuss what distinguishes database management systems from generic multi-threaded applications when it comes to live patching. We then propose domain-specific strategies for injecting quiescence points into the DBMS source code so that threads can safely migrate to the patched process version. We experimentally investigate the interplay between the query workload and different quiescence methods, monitoring both transaction throughput and tail latencies. We show that live patching can be a viable option for updating database management systems, since database providers can make informed decisions w.r.t. the latency overhead on the client side.",

However, trajectory data often contains errors stemming from inaccurate GPS measurements, low sampling rates, and transmission interruptions, yielding low-quality trajectory data with negative effects on downstream services.

    "abstract": "Tabular Natural Language Inference (TNLI) involves machine learning models that assess whether structured tabular data supports or contradicts a hypothesis formulated in natural language. TNLI models typically require large sets of training examples, which are costly to produce manually. In this demonstration, we present Tenet, a system for the automatic generation of training examples for TNLI applications. Existing TNLI training approaches either depend on costly human annotation or generate simplistic examples that lack data diversity and complex reasoning. In contrast, Tenet can start from a small set of manually annotated examples to automatically generate a large and diverse training dataset. Tenet is based on the idea that SQL queries are the right tool for obtaining rich and complex generated examples. To ensure data variety, evidence-queries extract cell values from tables based on diverse data patterns. Once the relevant data are identiﬁed, semantic queries deﬁne diﬀerent ways to interpret it using SQL clauses. These interpretations are then verbalized as text to create annotated examples for TNLI. This demonstration oﬀers an interactive experience where users will be able to select evidence from tabular data, inspect and reﬁne generated queries, and observe how Tenet transforms structured data into natural language hypotheses. By engaging with diﬀerent scenarios, users will see how Tenet enables the rapid creation of high-quality TNLI datasets, leading to inference models with performance comparable to those trained on manually crafted examples.",

    "abstract": "Existing disaggregated databases separate execution and storage layers, enabling independent and elastic scaling of resources. In most cases, this design makes transaction concurrency co ntrol (CC) a critical bottleneck, which demands significant computing resources for concurrent conflict management and struggles to scale due to the coordination overhead for concurrent conflict resolution. Coupling CC with execution or storage limits performance and elasticity, as CC’s resource needs do not align with the free scaling of the transaction execution layer or the storage-bound data layer. \nThis paper proposes Concurrency Control as a Service ( CCaaS ), which decouples CC from databases, building an execution-CCstorage three-layer decoupled database, allowing independent scaling and upgrades for improved elasticity, resource utilization, and development agility. However, adding a new layer increases latency due to the shift in communication from hardware to network. To address this, we propose a Sharded Multi-Write OCC (SM-OCC) algorithm with an asynchronous log push-down mechanism to minimize network communications overhead and transaction latency. Additionally, we implement a multi-write architecture with a deterministic conflict resolution method to reduce coordination overhead in the CC layer, thereby improving scalability.  CCaaS  is designed to be connected by a variety of execution and storage engines. Existing disaggregated databases can be revolutionized with  CCaaS to achieve high elasticity, scalability, and high performance. Results show that  CCaaS  achieves 1.02-3.11 ×  higher throughput and 1.11-2.75 ×  lower latency than SoTA disaggregated databases.",

    "abstract": "In data exploration, executing queries over a large database can be time-consuming. Previous work has proposed approximate query processing as a way to speed up aggregate queries in this context, but do not address non-aggregate queries. Our paper introduces a novel holistic approach to handle both types of queries by finding an optimized subset of data, referred to as an  approximation set . The goal is to maximize query result quality while using a smaller set of data, thereby significantly reducing the query execution time. We formalize this problem as Holistic Approximate Query Processing and establish its NP-completeness. To tackle this, we propose an approximate solution using  Reinforcement Learning , termed  HARLM . While  HARLM  does not provide theoretical guarantees due to its reliance on Reinforcement Learning, it effectively overcomes challenges related to the large action space and the need for generalization beyond a known query workload. Experimental results on both non-aggregate and aggregate benchmarks show that  HARLM  significantly outperforms the baselines both in terms of accuracy (30% improvement) and efficiency (10-35X).",

    "abstract": "Disaggregating memory from compute oﬀers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol, thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cacheownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling eﬃcient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC’s abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC signiﬁcantly outperforms RPC-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.",

    "abstract": "Data-centric machine learning (ML) pipelines extend traditional ML pipelines—of feature transformations, hyper-parameter tuning, and model training—by additional pre-processing steps for data cleaning, data augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality data with good coverage. Finding eﬀective data-centric ML pipelines is still a labor- and compute-intensive process though. While AutoML tools use eﬀective search strategies, they struggle to scale with large datasets. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for code generation but face challenges in generating datacentric ML pipelines due to private datasets not seen during training, complex pre-processing requirements, and the need for mitigating hallucinations. These demands exceed typical code generation as it requires actions tailored to the characteristics and requirements of a particular dataset. This paper introduces CatDB, a comprehensive, LLM-based system for generating eﬀective, error-free, and eﬃcient data-centric ML pipelines. CatDB leverages data catalog information and reﬁned metadata to dynamically create datasetspeciﬁc rules (instructions) to guide the LLM. Moreover, CatDB includes a robust mechanism for automatic validation and error handling of the generated pipeline. Our experimental results show that CatDB reliably generates eﬀective ML pipelines across diverse datasets, achieving accuracy comparable to or better than existing LLM-based systems, standalone AutoML tools, and combined workﬂows of data cleaning and AutoML tools, while delivering up to orders of magnitude faster performance on large datasets.",

    "abstract": "With the continued migration of storage to cloud database systems, the impact of slow queries in such systems on services and user experience is increasing. Root-cause diagnosis plays an indispensable role in facilitating slow-query detection and revision. This paper proposes a method capable of both identifying possible root cause types for slow queries and ranking these according to their potential for accelerating slow queries. This enables prioritizing root causes with the highest impact, in turn improving slow-query revision effectiveness. To enable more accurate and detailed diagnoses, we propose the multimodal Ranking for the Root Causes of slow queries ( RCRank ) framework, which formulates root cause analysis as a multimodal machine learning problem and leverages multimodal information from query statements, execution plans, execution logs, and key performance indicators. To obtain expressive embeddings from its heterogeneous multimodal input,  RCRank integrates self-supervised pre-training that enhances cross-modal alignment and task relevance. Next, the framework integrates rootcause-adaptive cross Transformers that enable adaptive fusion of multimodal features with varying characteristics. Finally, the framework offers a unified model that features an impact-aware training objective for identifying and ranking root causes. We report on experiments on real and synthetic datasets, finding that  RCRank  is capable of consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art methods at root cause identification and ranking according to a range of metrics.",

Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs  remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes  inference-friendly graph compression  ( IFGC ), a graph compression scheme to accelerate  GNNs  inference. Given a graph  𝐺 and a  GNN  𝑀 , an  IFGC  computes a small compressed graph  𝐺 𝑐 , to best preserve the inference results of  𝑀 over  𝐺 , such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing  𝐺 𝑐 with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize  IFGC  with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in  𝐺 that are not distinguishable for  GNN  inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of  IFGC  for representative  GNNs : structural preserving compression ( SPGC ), which computes 𝐺 𝑐 that can be directly processed by  GNN  inference without decompression;  ( 𝛼,𝑟 ) -compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of largescale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.",

The size of this index often becomes a memory bottleneck that makes it difficult to scale the system to large data sizes. To address this problem, the stateof-the-art approach is to structure this index as a succinct perfect hash table using only  ≈ 4 bits per key. The downside is that the hash table encoding is computationally expensive to parse and may harm overall system performance. \nWe introduce Sphinx, a succinct perfect hash table reengineered for high performance on commodity CPUs. Sphinx is encoded in a manner that lends itself to efficient access using rank and select primitives, and it uses auxiliary metadata to decode common hash table slots instantaneously. Sphinx is also expandable and parallelizable. We compare Sphinx to the best alternatives and show that it leads to a 2x reduction in query latency, update latency, and memory footprint.",

    "title": "Mining Platoon Patterns from Traffic Videos",
    "abstract": "Discovering co-movement patterns from urban-scale video data sources has emerged as an attractive topic. This task aims to identify groups of objects that travel together along a common route, which offers effective support for government agencies in enhancing smart city management. However, the previous work has made a strong assumption on the accuracy of recovered trajectories from videos and their co-movement pattern definition requires the group of objects to appear across consecutive cameras along the common route. In practice, this often leads to missing patterns if a vehicle is not correctly identified from a certain camera due to object occlusion or vehicle mis-matching. \nTo address this challenge, we propose a relaxed definition of co-movement patterns from video data, which removes the consecutiveness requirement in the common route and accommodates a certain number of missing captured cameras for objects within the group. Moreover, a novel enumeration framework called MaxGrowth is developed to efficiently retrieve the relaxed patterns. Unlike previous filter-and-refine frameworks comprising both candidate enumeration and subsequent candidate verification procedures, MaxGrowth incurs no verification cost for the candidate patterns. It treats the co-movement pattern as an equivalent sequence of clusters, enumerating candidates with increasing sequence length while avoiding the generation of any false positives. Additionally, we also propose two effective pruning rules to efficiently filter the non-maximal patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency of MaxGrowth and the quality of its generated co-movement patterns. Our MaxGrowth runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. It also demonstrates high accuracy in real video dataset when the trajectory recovery algorithm is not perfect.",

    "title": "Freely Moving Between the OLTP and OLAP Worlds: Hermes – an High-Performance OLAP Accelerator for MySQL",
    "abstract": "Users often want to run analytics on their OLTP databases, to avoid costly and cumbersome Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes. Typically, analytical queries run rather slow on OLTP DBMS, making Hybrid Transaction/Analytic Processing (HTAP) solutions popular. One possible solution is to add an accelerator (for analytics) to the already existing OLTP DBMS. \nTypically, analytical systems, especially for the cloud, focus on extremely large datasets (\"exa-scale\") and distributed query execution (across multiple machines). We argue that many customers do not have large enough datasets to justify expensive multi-node DBMSs. Compared to single-node systems, such multi-node systems typically come with a baseline drop in performance (but might scale), as they need to introduce data transfers across the network. \nFor this reason, we propose Hermes as cloud-native, but singlenode, accelerator for MySQL. Hermes speeds up analytical queries by, often 2-3, orders of magnitude and outperforms competing systems by up to 5 ×  (including multi-node systems). We achieve this by keeping Hermes relatively lean and focusing on the core features required. In the paper we describe Hermes’ architecture, data storage and integration with MySQL as well as Hermes’ query engine. Importantly, Hermes provides the highest degree of data freshness. If data is not replicated yet, Hermes waits. The waiting times, however, are practically negligible (single digit vs. three digit milliseconds). \nWe evaluate Hermes on TPC-H as well as micro-benchmarks. Besides the aforementioned improvements, our replication mechanisms achieved high and stable throughput rates of up to 60k changes per second, leading to low waiting times. \nIn summary, Hermes is a lean accelerator for MySQL. Its singlenode design keeps costs for users low and performance high. Additionally, Hermes guaranteeing data freshness and compatibility with MySQL (both, Hermes and MySQL, return the same result).",

    "title": "FLEET: High-Performance Durable Replicated State Machines using Scattered and Coordinated Log Entries",
    "abstract": "Distributed coordination services are fundamental components of distributed systems, employing durable replicated state machines (RSMs) to ensure consistency across replicas and prevent data loss, even in the event of all nodes failing. These services typically rely on persistent logs for rapid recovery, as a universally agreed-upon log allows replicas to restore their state by sequentially replaying ordered log entries. However, the requirement for a totally ordered log inherently limits opportunities for parallelism.\nThis paper introduces Fleet, a high-performance durable RSM protocol that combines a hybrid scattered-entry log with an asyn- chronous ordered log. Our approach integrates synchronous persis- tence of scattered entries with asynchronous persistence of ordered entries, ensuring both rapid recovery and high levels of parallelism. Additionally, we propose a parallel applying optimization for the etcd database, named pre-apply. Experimental results demonstrate that Fleet significantly outperforms Raft and Scalog in terms of throughput and latency, achieving up to 10× the throughput under specific configurations and scaling effectively across multiple nodes. Additionally, with the pre-apply optimization, Fleet delivers a 10- fold increase in throughput compared to sequential applying on etcd. Although Fleet incurs a 5% overhead in recovery time during leader failure, this delay is tolerable given the rarity of such events.",

    "title": "PBench: Workload Synthesizer with Real Statistics for Cloud Analytics Benchmarking",
    "abstract": "Cloud service providers commonly use standard benchmarks like TPC-H and TPC-DS to evaluate and optimize cloud data analytics systems. However, these benchmarks rely on !xed query patterns and fail to capture real execution statistics of production cloud workloads. Although some cloud database vendors have recently released real workload traces, these traces alone do not qualify as benchmarks, as they typically lack essential components (i.e., queries and databases). To overcome this limitation, this paper studies a new problem of  workload synthesis with real statistics , which generates  synthetic workloads  that closely approximate real execution statistics, including key performance metrics and operator distributions. To address this problem, we propose PBench, a novel workload synthesizer that constructs synthetic workloads by (1) selecting and combining workload components from existing benchmarks and (2) augmenting new workload components. This paper studies the key challenges in PBench. First, we address the challenge of balancing performance metrics and operator distributions by introducing a multi-objective optimization-based component selection method. Second, to capture the temporal dynamics of real workloads, we design a timestamp assignment method that progressively re!nes workload timestamps. Third, to handle the disparity between the original workload and the candidate workload, we propose a component augmentation approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate additional workload components while maintaining statistical !delity. Experimental results show that PBench reduces approximation error by up to 6 ³ compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "We study the similarity join problem from a systems perspective. A similarity join retrieves all similar record pairs from two collections based on a given distance function. Existing solutions are often optimized for a single distance function and domain. Such monolithic solutions are limited in both their extensibility to new distance functions and their robustness against changing data characteristics. \nTo address these challenges, we introduce Fast, a similarity join algorithm designed for extensible and robust query evaluation. It leverages a novel abstraction called reductions, which transform similarity join problems from complex domains into simpler ones. A reduction graph is constructed to systematically enumerate query plans. Since cost models for similarity queries are typically unavailable, Fast employs runtime partitioning and a sampling-based strategytoselectanear-optimalqueryplanwithperformanceguarantees. It can utilize prebuilt indexes or build them on-the-fly, incorporating caching techniques to accelerate index construction and probing. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, domains, and distance functions show that Fast consistently performs close to the optimal plan. Finally, two case studies highlight its strength as a baseline and its utility for prototyping future similarity join algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained signi￿cant attention in recent years due to their ability to learn representations of graphstructured data. Two common methods for training GNNs are minibatch training and full-graph training. Since these two methods require di￿erent training pipelines and systems optimizations, two separate classes of GNN training systems emerged, each tailored for one method. Works that introduce systems belonging to a particular category predominantly compare them with other systems within the same category, o￿ering limited or no comparison with systems from the other category. Some prior work also justi￿es its focus on one speci￿c training method by arguing that it achieves higher accuracy than the alternative. The literature, however, has incomplete and contradictory evidence in this regard. \nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of representative full-graph and mini-batch GNN training systems. We ￿nd that the mini-batch training systems consistently converge faster than the full-graph training ones across multiple datasets, GNN models, and system con￿gurations. We also ￿nd that minibatch training techniques converge to similar to or often higher accuracy values than full-graph training ones, showing that minibatch sampling is not necessarily detrimental to accuracy.

    "abstract": "Modern analytical database systems offer high-performance inmemory joins. However, if the build side of a join does not fit in RAM, performance degrades sharply due to switching to traditional external join algorithms such as sort-merge. In streaming query execution, this problem is worsened if multiple joins are evaluated simultaneously, as the database system must decide how to allocate memory to each join, which can greatly affect performance. \nWe revisit larger-than-memory join processing on modern hardware, aiming for robust performance that avoids a “performance cliff” when memory runs out, even in query plans with many joins. \nTo achieve this, we propose three techniques. First, an adaptive, external hash join algorithm that stores temporary data in a unified buffer pool that oversees temporary and persistent data. Second, an optimizer that creates expressions to compress columns at runtime, reducing the size of materialized temporary data. Third, a strategy for dynamically managing the memory of concurrent operators during query execution to reduce spilling. \nWe integrate these techniques into DuckDB and experimentally show that when processing memory-intensive join query plans, our implementation gracefully degrades performance as the space requirement exceeds the memory limit. This greatly increases the size of datasets that can be processed on economical hardware.",

    "abstract": "Relational databases are great for data analysis and exploration, but require a carefully crafted schema, which causes high manual overhead. Moreover, entities not considered during schema design cannot be stored. In contrast, schemaless approaches allow users to store all kinds of data without the need for a schema, but require schema-checking on read to ensure that queries can read certain attributes. We therefore advocate for a new class of database systems that organize the data in a schema autonomously when it is inserted schemalessly by users. Such databases should thus be able to store data semantically meaningful but without requiring the user to design a schema, neither upfront during setup nor when an insert is executed. In this demo, we showcase JUSTINE, which is a first implementation of this new class of database systems that can automatically adjust a database schema based on input queries. Our showcase features both (1) an interactive mode where attendees can enter their own data as well as (2) the execution of a full workload where users can see how the database schema evolves during batch execution. The workload can be customized by changing different parameters.",

    "title": "Optimal Sharding for Scalable Blockchains with Deconstructed SMR",
    "abstract": "Sharding enhances blockchain scalability by dividing nodes into multiple shards to handle transactions in parallel. However, a sizesecurity dilemma where every shard must be large enough to ensure its security constrains the efficacy of individual shards and the degree of sharding. Most existing solutions therefore rely on either weakening the adversary or making stronger network assumptions. \nThis paper presents Arete, an optimally scalable blockchain sharding protocol designed to resolve the dilemma based on an observation that if individual shards can tolerate a higher fraction of Byzantine faults, we can securely create smaller shards in a larger quantity. The key idea of Arete, therefore, is to improve the security resilience of shards by dividing the blockchain’s State Machine Replication (SMR) process. Like modern blockchains, Arete first decouples SMR in three steps: transaction dissemination, ordering, and execution. However, for Arete, a single ordering shard performs the ordering task while multiple processing shards perform the dissemination and execution of blocks. As processing shards do not run consensus, each of those tolerates up to half compromised nodes. Moreover, the SMR process in the ordering shard is extremely lightweight as it only operates on the block digests. Second, Arete considers safety and liveness against Byzantine failures separately to improve the safety threshold further while tolerating temporary liveness violations in a controlled manner. Apart from creating more optimal-size shards, such a deconstructed SMR scheme empowers us to devise a novel certify-order-execute architecture to fully parallelize transaction handling, thereby significantly improving the performance.

    "title": "QOVIS: Understanding and Diagnosing Query Optimizer via a Visualization-assisted Approach",
    "abstract": "Understanding and diagnosing query optimizers is crucial to guarantee the correctness and efficiency of query processing in database systems. However, achieving this is non-trivial as there are three technical challenges: (i) hundreds and thousands of query plans are generated for each query during the query optimization procedure; (ii) the transformation logic among query plans is not easy to investigate even for expert database system developers; and (iii) navigating users to the root causes of the bugs/errors is inherently hard as the changes of the operators among query plans are missing in the query processing log. In this work, we propose QOVIS  to overcome these challenges, which identifies the query optimization bugs/issues and investigates their root causes via a visualization-assisted approach. Specifically,  QOVIS  consists of data preprocessing layer, transformation logic computation layer, and visual analysis layer. We conduct extensive experimental studies (e.g., user study, case study, and performance study) to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of  QOVIS . In particular, our user study (on 24 database developers and researchers) confirms that  QOVIS significantly reduces the time required to investigate the bugs/errors in the query optimizer. Moreover, the generality of  QOVIS  is verified by utilizing it to understand and diagnose the real-world reported bugs/errors in different query optimizers of three widelyused systems: Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and DuckDB.",

    "title": "Turbocharging Vector Databases using Modern SSDs",
    "abstract": "Efficient and scalable vector search is critical for modern AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large-scale semantic search. However, disk-based vector databases often suffer from significant I/O bottlenecks due to suboptimal cache hit ratios and inefficient use of modern SSD architectures. In this work, we introduce a suite of optimizations to enhance the performance of disk-resident Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indices, specifically focusing on hierarchical graph-based indexing such as HNSW. Our approach leverages three key strategies: (1) Parallel I/O leveraging io_uring to exploit SSD concurrency and reduce retrieval latency, (2) Spatially-aware insertion reordering to improve cache efficiency by dynamically adjusting insert execution order based on locality, and (3) Locality-preserving colocation to restructure index layouts and minimize costly random disk accesses. \nWe implement these techniques within  pgvector , a  PostgreSQL extension for vector search, and conduct extensive evaluations using real-world datasets. Our optimizations yield up to 11.1 ×  improvement in query throughput, a 3.23 ×  increase in cache hit ratio, and a 98.4% reduction in index build time. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of SSD-aware indexing strategies for scalable vector retrieval. By integrating hardware-aware I/O optimizations with intelligent data placement techniques, this work paves the way for more efficient, high-performance disk-based vector search engines that could fully leverage modern SSD’s high parallelism.",

    "abstract": "GPU-accelerated databases have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth. The limited GPU memory capacity, however, is still a major bottleneck for GPU databases. \nExisting approaches have attempted to address this limitation by using (1) hybrid CPU-GPU DBMS or (2) multi-GPU DBMS. We aim to improve prior solutions further by leveraging both hybrid CPU- GPU DBMS and multi-GPU DBMS at the same time. In particular, we explore the design space and optimize the data placement and query execution in hybrid CPU and multi-GPU DBMS. To improve data placement, we introduce the cache-aware replication policy which takes into account the cost of shuffle when replicating data and could coordinate both caching and replication decisions for the best performance. To improve query execution, we extend the existing hybrid CPU-GPU query execution strategy with distributed query processing techniques to support multiple GPUs. We build a system called Lancelot, a hybrid CPU and Multi-GPU data analytics engine with all the optimizations integrated. \nOur evaluation shows that the cache-aware replication outperforms other policies by up to 2.5× and Lancelot outperforms existing GPU DBMSes by at least 2× on Star Schema Benchmark and 12× on TPC-H Benchmark.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops  Planar  ( Plug and play PRAM), a single-machine system for graph analytics by reusing existing PRAM algorithms, without the need for designing new parallel algorithms.  Planar supports both out-of-core and in-memory analytics.

For an in-memory task, it dedicates all available CPU cores to the task, and allows parallelly scalable PRAM algorithms to retain the property,  i.e.,  the more cores are available, the less runtime is taken. We develop a graph partitioning and work scheduling strategy to accommodate subgraph I/O, balance memory usage and reduce runtime, beyond traditional partitioners for multi-machine systems.

    "title": "Interactive Graph Search for Multiple Targets on DAGs",
    "abstract": "Interactive graph search (IGS) over DAGs aims to find a hidden target by asking interactive questions as few as possible. IGS is useful for many applications, e.g., facilitating supervised learning tasks by harnessing labeled data, image categorization, and product classification. However, most of the existing IGS methods only work for either  single target search on DAGs  or  multiple targets search on simple trees . To overcome the gap, it motivates us to study a challenging and yet not solved problem of multiple targets search over DAGs. We analyze the new problem in-depth and propose a key concept of uncertain candidates. Based on it, we design an effective gain function to determine the best vertex to be asked questions and shrink the search space of potential targets greatly. Leveraging our uncertain candidates and gain function, we develop a unified  k-EIS  framework to search both single target and multiple targets. We analyze all algorithm complexities and theoretically show that our solution can significantly improve existing DFS-treebased methods by asking 𝑂(𝑛) questions to 𝑂(log2  𝑛)  questions in worst cases. To further improve IGS for multiple targets, we propose an advanced solution by dividing the whole DAG into 𝑘 disjoint subgraphs with single targets and then tackling each subgraph one by one independently. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our proposed k-EIS framework can save lots of questions to search exact targets against four state-of-the-art IGS competitors.",

We then examine the extensibility of six DBMSs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Redis, and DuckDB. We present an automated extension analysis toolkit that collects static and dynamic information on how an extension integrates into the DBMS. Our evaluation of over 400 PostgreSQL extensions shows that 16.8% of them are incompatible with at least one other extension and can cause system failures.

    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is a critical spatio-temporal data mining task with wide-ranging applications in intelligent route planning and dynamic traffic management. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these forecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the scalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in model complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to address this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based approaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk compromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet), a novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of GNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core modules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules operate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall computational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not only significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art linear models but also maintains high predictive performance.",

Many subtle and catastrophic bugs occur during software rollout. There are many existing techniques to improve the odds of a rollout completing successfully, but these techniques don’t work well when the application has shared, persistent, mutable state. In this paper, we present a practical framework to test the rollout of stateful applications. Our framework uses diff testing to verify that the new version of an application behaves identically to the currently running version that will be replaced. The framework has three main components to safely and efficiently compare the behavior of the two versions. First, we implement database branching on top of Postgres. Second, we implement an efficient algorithm to diff two database branches. Third, we describe how to replay client requests to improve test coverage. Finally, we identify three common categories of rollout bugs and demonstrate how our framework can find these bugs with minimal performance overhead.",

    "abstract": "Although user-defined functions (UDFs) are a popular way to aug- ment SQL’s declarative approach with procedural code, the mis- match between programming paradigms creates a fundamental optimization challenge. UDF inlining automatically removes all UDF calls by replacing them with equivalent SQL subqueries. Al- though inlining leaves queries entirely in SQL (resulting in large performance gains), we observe that inlining the entire UDF often leads to sub-optimal performance. A better approach is to analyze the UDF, deconstruct it into smaller pieces, and inline only the pieces that help query optimization. To achieve this, we propose UDF outlining, a technique to intentionally hide pieces of a UDF from the optimizer, resulting in simpler UDFs and significantly faster query plans. Our implementation (PRISM) demonstrates that UDF outlining improves performance over conventional inlining (on average 1.29× speedup for DuckDB and 298.73× for SQL Server) through a combination of more effective unnesting, improved data skipping, and by avoiding unnecessary joins.",

In reality, multiple services may be interested in collecting users’ data, which poses privacy burdens to users as more such services emerge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework for collecting and aggregating data based on perturbed information from multiple services, regardless of their estimated statistics (e.g., mean or distribution) and perturbation mechanisms. \nThen for mean estimation, we introduce the Unbiased Averaging (UA) method and its optimized version, User-level Weighted Averaging (UWA). The former utilizes biased perturbed data, while the latter assigns weights to different perturbed results based on perturbation information, thereby achieving minimal variance. For distribution estimation, we propose the User-level Likelihood Estimation (ULE), which treats all perturbed results from a user as a whole for maximum likelihood estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework and constituting methods significantly improve the accuracy of both mean and distribution estimation.",

    "abstract": "We present Keigo, a concurrency- and workload-aware storage middleware that enhances the performance of log-structured merge key-value stores (LSM KVS) when they are deployed on a hierarchy of storage devices. The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no  one-size-fits-all  placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques –  concurrency-aware data placement ,  persistent read-only caching , and  context-based I/O differentiation . Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. \nWe evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4 ×  for write- and 18 ×  for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed historical 𝑘-core query introduces a new paradigm of structure analysis for temporal graphs. However, the query processing based on the existing PHC-index, which preserves the distinct “core time” of each vertex, needs to traverse all vertices for each query, even though the results usually contain only a small subset of vertices. Inspired by the traditional 𝑘-shell that ensures the optimal 𝑘-core query processing, we propose a novel concept called “core time shell”, which reveals the hierarchical structure of vertices with respect to their core time. Based on the core time shell, we design a time-space balanced Merged Core Time Shell index (MCTS-index). It is theoretically guaranteed that, the MCTS-index provides the approximately optimal query performance, and has the approximately same space complexity as the PHC-index. Moreover, we leverage the MCTS-index to efficiently address the brand-new “when” historical 𝑘-core queries orthogonal to the current “what” historical 𝑘 -core queries. Our experimental results on ten real-world temporal graphs demonstrate both the superior efficiency of pro- cessing “what” queries and the effectiveness of processing versatile “when” queries for the MCTS-index.",

    "abstract": "In modern database management systems (DBMS), data retrieval typically requires traversing multiple layers—such as secondary indexes, primary indexes, and buffer pools—which introduces significant overhead and creates performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that minimizes this overhead by establishing more direct access paths during data retrieval. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains across various DBMS components, including secondary indexing and concurrency control mechanisms. Specifically, we observe that implementing direct access paths can boost the throughput of transaction processing systems by up to 19 . 7 ×  when executing the TPC-Clike benchmark with 40 threads. Furthermore, our approach holds promise for broader applications, potentially transforming data retrieval practices by enabling efficient handling of data movements with minimal overhead.",

    "abstract": "𝑘-plexes relax cliques by allowing each vertex to disconnect to at most 𝑘 vertices. Finding a maximum 𝑘-plex in a graph is a funda- mental operator in graph mining and has been receiving significant attention from various domains. The state-of-the-art algorithms all adopt the branch-reduction-and-bound (BRB) framework where a key step, called reduction-and-bound (RB), is used for narrow- ing down the search space. A common practice of RB in existing works is SeqRB, which sequentially conducts the reduction pro- cess followed by the bounding process once at a branch. However, these algorithms suffer from the efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a new alternated reduction-and-bound method AltRB for conducting RB. AltRB first partitions a branch into two parts and then alternatively and iteratively conducts the reduction process and the bounding process at each part of a branch. With newly- designed reduction rules and bounding methods, AltRB is superior to SeqRB in effectively narrowing down the search space in both theory and practice. Further, to boost the performance of BRB algo- rithms, we develop efficient and effective pre-processing methods which reduce the size of the input graph and heuristically compute a large 𝑘-plex as the lower bound. We conduct extensive experi- ments on 664 real and synthetic graphs. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm kPEX with AltRB and novel pre- processing techniques runs up to two orders of magnitude faster and solves more instances than state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "title": "[Industry] From Scale-Up to Scale-Out: PolarDB’s Journey to Achieving 2 Billion tpmC",
    "abstract": "In the past decade, cloud databases have experienced rapid development and growth. PolarDB, Alibaba’s cloud-native OLTP database, has evolved significantly to meet the increasing demand for cloud-native architectures and now serves hundreds of thousands of customers across various industries. \nThis paper presents PolarDB’s evolution over the past eight years, with a focus on scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency. Initially, PolarDB adopted a primary-replica architecture based on disaggregated storage, with an emphasis on enhancing single-node performance for scale-up in modern many-core systems. To achieve this, we co-designed PolarDB with cutting-edge hardware, including RDMA, to improve performance. Meanwhile, we refined the internal architecture, including improvements to B+ tree concurrency control and transaction management, ensuring high scalability in scale-up scenarios. More recently, our focus has shifted to scaling out PolarDB to meet the performance and scalability needs of ultra-large-scale applications. By leveraging RDMA, we optimized distributed transaction processing,  transforming PolarDB into a high-performance, high-scalability and cost-effective distributed database . In the TPC-C benchmark, PolarDB scaled out to 2340 nodes and achieved over 2 billion tpmC, with a jitter rate of no more than 0.16% during the 8-hour stress test. Compared to the second- and third-highest-performing databases in public TPC-C results, PolarDB’s tpmC is 2.52 ×  and 2.91 ×  higher, respectively. In terms of cost-effectiveness, PolarDB’s per-tpmC cost is 37% and 79.5% lower than that of the other two systems, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate  ExGIS , a parallel inference query engine to support explainable Graph Neural Network ( GNNs ) inference analysis in large graphs. (1) For a class of  GNNs  M 𝐿 with at most  𝐿 layers, and a graph  𝑀 ,  ExGIS  performs an o!ine, once-for-all compression of  𝑀 to a small graph  𝑀 𝑀 , such that for any inference query  𝑁 that requests the output of any  GNN  𝑂 →M 𝐿 on any node  𝑃 in  𝑀 ,  𝑀 𝑀 can be directly queried to yield correct output without decompression.

It dynamically partitions 𝑄 to balance workloads, and (a) executes inference that only consults compressed graph  𝑀 𝑀 without decompression, and (b) directly yields concise, explanatory subgraphs from  𝑀 𝑀 that can clarify the query output with high fidelity, all in parallel. Moreover,  ExGIS integrates visual, interactive interfaces for query performance analysis, and a Large Language Models (LLMs)- enabled interpreter to support user-friendly, natural language explanation of query outputs. We demonstrate the compression rate and scalability of ExGIS , and its application in interpretable anomaly detection over bitcoin transaction networks and academic networks.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation (SDG) is the process of generating a new synthetic dataset based on the statistical properties of a confidential existing dataset. Differential privacy is the property of a SDG mechanism that establishes how protected individuals whose sensitive data is part of the confidential dataset are, when sharing such data. To ensure a SDG is differentially private, noise is injected into the statistics learned from the dataset. Depending on the amount of noise injected, we witness a trade-off between privacy and utility. Privacy is then measured via a set of privacy metrics that usually establish a lower bound on a few aspects of the privacy-utility tradeoff. Therefore, it is not possible to assess privacy based only on one metric. To close this gap, we demonstrate PrivEval, a tool to assist users in evaluating the privacy properties of a synthetic dataset. PrivEval implements several privacy metrics and validates them on both a single user and the overall dataset. Besides, PrivEval checks assumptions behind each metric. Hence, PrivEval is a first step to bridge the gap between privacy experts and the general public to make privacy estimation more transparent.",

    "title": "NeutronTask: Scalable and Efficient Multi-GPU GNN Training with Task Parallelism",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising method for learning from graph data, but large-scale GNN training requires extensive memory and computation resources. To address this, researchers have proposed using multi-GPU processing, which partitions graph data across GPUs for parallel training. However, vertex dependencies in multi-GPU GNN training lead to significant neighbor replications across GPUs, increasing memory consumption. The substantial intermediate data generated during training further exacerbates this issue. Neighbor replication and intermediate data constitute the primary memory consumption in GNN training (i.e., typically accounting for over 80%). In this work, we propose GNN task parallelism for multi-GPU GNN training, which reduces neighbor replication by partitioning training tasks in each layer across different GPUs rather than partitioning the graph structure. This approach only partitions the graph data within individual GPUs, reducing the memory requirements of single tasks while overlapping subgraph computation across different GPUs. Shared neighbor embeddings among different subgraphs can be efficiently reused within a single GPU. Additionally, we employ a task-decoupled GNN training framework, which decouples different training tasks to manage their associated intermediate data independently and release it as early as possible to reduce memory usage. By integrating these techniques, we propose a multi-GPU GNN training system, NeutronTask. Experimental results on a 4 × A5000 GPU server show that NeutronTask effectively supports billion-scale full-graph GNN training. For small graphs where the training data fits into the GPUs, NeutronTask achieves 1.27 ×  - 5.47 ×  speedup compared to state-of-the-art GNN systems including NeutronStar and Sancus.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the reliability of data pipelines is critical for modern datadriven organizations, yet building robust Continuous Integration (CI) in large, distributed data warehouses remains a signi!cant challenge. Complexities arising from distributed ownership, the high cost of replicating production environments, and the rapid evolution of business logic lead to fragile pipelines and costly failures. This paper introduces a novel CI framework designed to conquer these challenges, achieving 94.5% pre-production issue detection in YouTube’s data warehouse while dramatically reducing resource consumption. Our key innovation lies in a productioncon!guration-driven testing methodology, that enables scalable, isolated testing directly within the production environment. This approach reduces testing overhead and ensures high test !delity. Furthermore, we present a lineage-aware impact analysis framework that automatically propagates data quality checks across distributed pipeline components based on an algebraic dependency model, ensuring data consistency and promoting cross-team collaboration. This production-proven solution provides a practical blueprint for CI/CD in complex, large-scale environments.",

    "abstract": "Datalog is a popular logic programming language for deductive reasoning tasks in a wide array of applications, including business analytics, program analysis, and ontological reasoning. However, Datalog’s restriction to flat facts over atomic constants leads to challenges in working with tree-structured data, such as derivation trees or abstract syntax trees. To ameliorate Datalog’s restrictions, popular extensions of Datalog support features such as existential quantification in rule heads (Datalog ± , Datalog ∃ ) or algebraic data types (Soufflé). Unfortunately, these are imperfect solutions for reasoning over structured and recursive data types, with general existentials leading to complex implementations requiring unifi-existentials leading to complex implementations requiring unification, and ADTs unable to trigger rule evaluation and failing to support efficient indexing. \nWe present  DL ∃ ! , a Datalog with first-class facts, wherein every fact is identified with a Skolem term unique to the fact. We show that this restriction offers an attractive price point for Datalog-that this restriction offers an attractive price point for Datalogbased reasoning over tree-shaped data, demonstrating its appli-based reasoning over tree-shaped data, demonstrating its application to databases, artificial intelligence, and programming lan-cation to databases, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. We implemented  DL ∃ !   as a system Slog, which leverages the uniqueness restriction of  DL ∃ !   to enable a communication-the uniqueness restriction of  DL ∃ !   to enable a communicationavoiding, massively-parallel implementation built on MPI. We show that Slog outperforms leading systems (Nemo, Vlog, RDFox, and Soufflé) on a variety of benchmarks, with the potential to scale to thousands of threads.",

    "title": "AutoPrep: Natural Language Question-Aware Data Preparation with a Multi-Agent Framework",
    "abstract": "Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose  AutoPrep , a large language model (LLM)-based multiagent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components.  Planner : Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations.  Programmer : Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor : Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-ofClauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation. Extensive experiments on real-world TQA datasets demonstrate that AutoPrep can significantly improve the state-of-the-art TQA solutions through question-aware data preparation.",

    "abstract": "TrueTime clocks (TTCs) that offer accurate and reliable time within limited uncertainty bounds have been increasingly implemented in many clouds. Multi-region data stores that seek decentralized synchronization for high performance represent an ideal application of TTC. However, the co-designs between the two often failed to realize their full potential. This paper proposes K2, a multi-region data store that explores the opportunity of using TTC for distributed transactions. Compared to its pioneer, Google Spanner, K2 augments TTC’s semantics in three core design pillars. First, K2 carries a new timestamp-generating scheme that is capable of providing a small time uncertainty bound at scale. Second, K2 revitalizes existing multi-version timestamp-ordered concurrency control to realize multi-version properties for read-write transactions. Third, K2 introduces a new TTC-based visibility control protocol that provides efficient reads at replicas. Our evaluation shows that, K2 achieves an order of magnitude higher transaction throughput relative to other geo-distributed transaction protocols while ensuring a lower visibility delay at asynchronous replicas.",

    "title": "Nitro: Boosting Distributed Reinforcement Learning with Serverless Computing",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated significant potential in various applications, including gaming AI, robotics, and system scheduling. DRL algorithms produce, sample, and learn from training data online through a trial-and-error process, demanding considerable time and computational resources. To address this, distributed DRL algorithms and paradigms have been developed to expedite training using extensive resources. Through carefully designed experiments, we are the first to observe that strategically increasing the actor-environment interactions by spawning more concurrent actors at certain training rounds within ephemeral time frames can significantly enhance training efficiency. Yet, current distributed DRL solutions, which are predominantly server-based (or serverful), fail to capitalize on these opportunities due to their long startup times, limited adaptability, and cumbersome scalability.\nThis paper proposes Nitro, a generic training engine for dis- tributed DRL algorithms that enforces timely and effective boost- ing with concurrent actors instantaneously spawned by serverless computing. With serverless functions, Nitro adjusts data sampling strategies dynamically according to the DRL training demands. Ni- tro seizes the opportunity of real-time boosting by accurately and swiftly detecting an empirical metric. To achieve cost efficiency, we design a heuristic actor scaling algorithm to guide Nitro for cost-aware boosting budget allocation. We integrate Nitro with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and frameworks and evaluate them on AWS EC2 and Lambda. Experiments with Mujoco and Atari benchmarks show that Nitro improves the final rewards (i.e., train- ing quality) by up to 6× and reduces training costs by up to 42%.",

    "abstract": "Acyclic join queries can be evaluated instance-optimally using Yannakakis’ algorithm, which avoids needlessly large intermediate results through semi-join passes. Recent work proposes to address the significant hidden constant factors arising from a naive implementation of Yannakakis by decomposing the hash join operator into two suboperators, called Lookup and Expand. We present a novel method for integrating Lookup and Expand plans in interpreted environments, like column stores, formalizing them using Nested Semijoin Algebra (NSA) and implementing them through a shredding approach. We characterize the class of NSA expressions that can be evaluated instance-optimally as those that are 2-phase: no ‘shrinking’ operator is applied after an unnest (i.e., expand). We introduce Shredded Yannakakis ( SYA ), an evaluation algorithm for acyclic joins that, starting from a binary join plan, transforms it into a 2-phase NSA plan, and then evaluates it through the shredding technique. We show that  SYA  is provably robust (i.e., never produces large intermediate results) and without regret (i.e., is never worse than the binary join plan under a suitable cost model) on the class of well-behaved binary join plans. Our experiments on a suite of 1,849 queries show that  SYA  improves performance for 85 . 3% of the queries with speedups up to 62.5x, while remaining competitive on the other queries.",

    "title": "BIRDIE: Natural Language-Driven Table Discovery Using Differentiable Search Index",
    "abstract": "Natural language (NL)-driven table discovery identifies relevant tables from large table repositories based on NL queries. While current deep-learning-based methods using the traditional dense vector search pipeline, i.e.,  representation-index-search , achieve remarkable accuracy, they face several limitations that impede further performance improvements: (i) the errors accumulated during the table representation and indexing phases affect the subsequent search accuracy; and (ii) insufficient query-table interaction hinders effective semantic alignment, impeding accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search index. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder language model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns each table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based query generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the mapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table identifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling deep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly generates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual indexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter isolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Birdie outperforms state-of-the-art dense methods by 16.8% in accuracy, and reduces forgetting by over 90% compared to other continual learning approaches.",

    "title": "The Accuracy of Cardinality Estimators: Unraveling the Evaluation Result Conundrum",
    "abstract": "Existing research on the accuracy of cardinality estimators generally suffers from a lack of diversity and sufficient quantity of their experimental datasets, particularly in relation to the claimed scope of the study and the generality of its conclusions. We argue that a sufficiently large number of varied datasets are essential for comprehensive evaluations. However, the prevailing per-dataset evaluation method (PDE), producing one result table per dataset, has so far hindered this necessary expansion of the experiments. Moreover, as we demonstrate, this evaluation method often leaves the reader with contradictory results, where one estimator excels on certain datasets or queries, while the other performs better elsewhere. To address these and similar limitations, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework. This framework unravels the conundrum of analyzing the evaluation results across multiple datasets through the use of discretization. It establishes a robust foundation for aggregating the evaluation results and conducting pairwise comparisons between estimators. Furthermore, it facilitates informed decision making in the presence of conflicting results through a customizable ranking mechanism. \nTo empirically highlight the shortcomings of the aforementioned per-dataset evaluation and demonstrate the advantages of our proposed framework, we conduct a benchmarking study of cardinality estimators, incorporating both learned and traditional approaches. We focus on a fundamental challenge: estimating the cardinality of range queries on a single 2-D geographical relation in a static environment. Despite the apparent simplicity of this task, our findings reveal that many estimators struggle to handle this challenge effectively. To further enhance the quality of our study, we provide valuable insights by addressing some critical aspects that were overlooked in previous benchmarking studies.",

    "title": "HoliPaxos: Towards More Predictable Performance in State Machine Replication",
    "abstract": "State machine replication (SMR) algorithms ensure redundancy in critical systems and, as a result, underpin fault-tolerant distributed databases. Good SMR protocol performance is essential for capacity planning and meeting desired performance objectives. However, many implementations of popular SMR algorithms, such as MultiPaxos and Raft, have issues that make their performance unpredictable. This unpredictability often arises from certain “bolt-on” additions to core protocols, such as external failure detectors and replication log compaction. In this paper, we argue that tighter integration of such traditionally ad-hoc mechanisms with the core replication protocols can stabilize performance, making the solutions more reliable and more accessible to accurate capacity planning. Moreover, we show that these integrations can be nondisruptive for the underlying consensus algorithm, resulting in systems that preserve the simplicity and safety of traditional singleleader consensus-based SMR. To that order, we integrate the failure and slowdown detectors inside the SMR and achieve better performance and faster fail-over under various network partitions and node slowdown events. We also illustrate that tight integration of replication log management, pruning, and snapshotting can reduce memory and CPU usage while avoiding performance fluctuations associated with traditional log compaction and cleanup approaches.",

    "title": "Maximum Inner Product is Query-Scaled Nearest Neighbor",
    "abstract": "Maximum Inner Product Search ( MIPS ) for high-dimensional vectors is pivotal across databases, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence. Existing methods either reduce  MIPS  to Nearest Neighbor Search ( NNS ) while suffering from harmful vector space transformations, or attempt to tackle  MIPS  directly but struggle to mitigate redundant computations due to the absence of the triangle inequality. This paper presents a novel theoretical framework that equates  MIPS  with  NNS  without requiring space transformation, thereby allowing us to leverage advanced graph-based indices for NNS  and efficient edge pruning strategies, significantly reducing unnecessary computations. Despite a strong baseline set by our theoretical analysis, we identify and address two persistent challenges to further refine our method: the introduction of the   P roximity Graph with   S pherical   P athway ( PSP ), designed to mitigate the issue of  MIPS  solutions clustering around large-norm vectors, and the implementation of   A daptive   E arly   T ermination (AET), which efficiently curtails the excessive exploration once an accuracy bottleneck is reached. Extensive experiments reveal that our method is superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques in search efficiency, scalability, and practical applicability. Compared with state-of-theart graph-based methods, it achieves an average 35% speed-up in query processing and a 3 ×  reduction in index size. Notably, our approach has been validated and deployed in the search engines of Shopee, a well-known online shopping platform. Our code and an industrial-scale dataset for offline evaluation will also be released to address the absence of e-commerce data in public benchmarks.",

    "title": "LakeVisage: Towards Scalable, Flexible and Interactive Visualization Recommendation for Data Discovery over Data Lakes",
    "abstract": "Data discovery from data lakes is an essential application in modern data science. While many previous studies focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data discovery, little attention has been paid to the usability of such applications. In particular, exploring data discovery results can be cumbersome due to the cognitive load involved in understanding raw tabular results and identifying insights to draw conclusions. To address this challenge, we introduce a new problem: visualization recommendation for data discovery over data lakes, which aims to automatically identify visualizations that highlight relevant or desired trends in the results returned by data discovery engines. We propose  LakeVisage , an end-to-end framework as the first solution to this problem. Given a data lake, a data discovery engine, and a user-specified query table, LakeVisage  intelligently explores the space of visualizations and recommends the most useful and “interesting” visualization plans. To this end, we developed (i) approaches to smartly construct the candidate visualization plans from the results of the data discovery engine and (ii) effective pruning strategies to filter out less interesting plans so as to accelerate the visual analysis. Experimental results on real data lakes demonstrate that our proposed techniques can achieve an order-of-magnitude speedup in visualization recommendation. We also conduct a comprehensive user study to demonstrate that  LakeVisage  offers convenience to users in real data analysis applications by enabling them seamlessly get started with the tasks and performing explorations flexibly.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based indexes have been widely employed to accelerate approximate similarity search of high-dimensional vectors. However, the performance of graph indexes to answer different queries varies vastly, leading to an unstable quality of service for downstream applications. This necessitates an effective measure to test query hardness on graph indexes. Nonetheless, popular distance-based hardness measures like LID lose their effects due to the ignorance of the graph structure. In this paper, we propose 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness, a novel connection-based graph-native query hardness measure. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical framework to analyze theminimumqueryeffortongraphindexesandthendefine𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness as the minimum effort on a representative graph. Moreover, we prove that our 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness is highly relevant to the classical Directed 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟 Tree (DST) problems. In this case, we design a novel algorithm to reduce our problem to DST problems and then leverage their solvers to help calculate 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness efficiently. Compared with LID and other similar measures, 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness shows a significantly better correlation with the actual query effort on various datasets. Additionally, an unbiased evaluation designed based on 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟-hardness reveals new ranking results, indicating a meaningful direction for enhancing the robustness of graph indexes.",

    "title": "Conformal Prediction for Verifiable Learned Query Optimization",
    "abstract": "Query optimization is critical in relational databases. Recently, numerous Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs) have been proposed, demonstrating superior performance over traditional hand-crafted query optimizers after short training periods. However, the opacity and instability of machine learning models have limited their practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first to formulate the LQO verification as a Conformal Prediction (CP) problem. We first construct a CP model and obtain user-controlled bounded ranges for the actual latency of LQO plans before execution. Then, we introduce CP-based runtime verification along with violation handling to ensure performance prior to execution. For both scenarios, we further extend our framework to handle distribution shifts in the dynamic environment using adaptive CP approaches. Finally, we present CP-guided plan search, which uses actual latency upper bounds from CP to heuristically guide query plan construction. We integrated our verification framework into three LQOs (Balsa, Lero, and RTOS) and conducted evaluations on several workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is both accurate and efficient. Our CP-based approaches achieve tight upper bounds, reliably detect and handle violations. Adaptive CP maintains accurate confidence levels even in the presence of distribution shifts, and the CP-guided plan search improves both query plan quality (up to 9.84x) and planning time, with a reduction of up to 74.4% for a single query and 9.96% across all test queries from trained LQOs.",

When the query performs entity resolution (aka record linkage or deduplication), the problem is that of estimating the number of distinct entities, referred to as the  entity count . This problem has received attention from the statistics community but it has been largely overlooked in the data management literature. In this work, we formally define the entity count problem from a data management perspective and decompose it into a framework of fundamental steps. We explore approaches from both statistics and data management, systematically identifying a design space for different pipelines that address this problem.

    "abstract": "Continuous Queries (CQs) run inde!nitely, processing in!nite data streams and producing continuous outputs. They commonly use window functions to segment streams into !nite chunks for compu- tation. Ensuring data integrity in CQs is challenging, involving, for example, streaming joins for binary constraints. Current methods, like dropping or repairing inconsistent data, can harm throughput and increase latency. This paper proposes a novel approach using provenance-based techniques to map violations in input streams to CQ results with minimal overhead. This ensures continuous data flow and maintains the analytical integrity of CQs. Our study explores the feasibility and effciency of this method, addressing a signi!cant gap in applying provenance techniques to streaming data. While provenance-based techniques have proven effective for static data, their application in streaming contexts remains unexplored. Our solution addresses this gap, achieving a stable throughput across increasingly demanding memory loads wrt to the baselines, spacing between a 10% increase for medium-sized buffers (i.e., the windows), up to 80% for heavier loads. Moreover, results show the minimal impact of annotation (up to 25%) in the total execution runtime, demonstrating the effectiveness of our graph-based approach.",

    "abstract": "Distributed datastores underpin highly concurrent, read-intensive applications, ensuring consistency, availability, and performance. They use crash-tolerant protocols to replicate data and endure replica server crashes. To ensure safety and meet the performance demands, replication must support high-throughput, strongly consistent (i.e., linearizable) reads without assuming any synchrony. However, existing protocols either \n1  relax consistency, or provide linearizable reads that are \n2  fully asynchronous but remote (involving multiple replicas), or \n3  local but require synchrony. This work explores the tradeoﬀs between consistency, asynchrony, and performance in crash-tolerant protocols, and proves that  in linearizable asynchronous read/write registers tolerating a single crash, no reads can be local . Building on this, we introduce almost-local reads  (ALRs), a new abstraction that ensures crash tolerance and linearizability under asynchrony. While ALRs have slightly higher latency than local reads, they remain lightweight, with computation and network costs close to single-node reads. \nWe present two simple yet eﬀective ALR schemes that enhance protocols across all three categories. For protocols with local reads, ALRs address consistency or synchrony issues with minimal throughput loss. In asynchronous linearizable protocols, they improve performance without compromises. Our evaluation shows that ALRenhanced ZAB and Hermes achieve within 2% and 5% of their original throughput in 95% reads while ensuring linearizability under asynchrony. On Raft, ALRs deliver over 2.5× higher throughput without compromising consistency or asynchrony.",

These approaches are unable to use sufficient data for accurate database understanding due to limitations in data selection methods, and they cannot input the entire database due to the limited context window sizes of LLMs. This insufficient data integration may result in an incomplete understanding of the database, leading to semantically incorrect SQL generation. In this paper, we introduce REDSQL, a novel plugand-play framework that refines the predicted SQL by utilizing the entire database in the refinement process. The core idea of REDSQL is to enhance SQL refinement by identifying potential errors based on the database content, which is achieved by applying constraints on the input relations of query operations. LLMs can refine the SQL using SQL-related information extracted by REDSQL, which provides concise and informative insights into the database. Additionally, REDSQL enhances schema semantics by integrating data profiling for more effective database utilization. Our experiments demonstrate that REDSQL consistently improves the performance of existing NL2SQL approaches across five benchmarks. Specifically, REDSQL elevates the accuracy of CODES to 67.3% (+8.8%) and PURPLE to 67.7% (+11.1%) on the  Bird  benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized social graphs, where no single entity possesses the information of the entire graph, and each user maintains only a limited view of the graph, contain great value for different applications. However, simply collecting local views for analytics raises privacy concerns due to the sensitive information of social relationships they capture. To address this, a canonical approach involves privately fitting a generative graph model to the decentralized social graph, generating a differentially private synthetic graph that serves as a proxy for analytics. Existing solutions, however, often fail to capture the inherent directionality of edges and attributeedge correlations when dealing with decentralized directed social graphs, leading to synthetic graphs with poor utility. To bridge this gap, we present PrivAGM, a new solution that harnesses the synergies among differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, and generative graph models, enabling the secure construction of differentially private directed attributed graph models on decentralized social graphs while ensuring the privacy preservation of individuals. We evaluate PrivAGM on three real-world directed social graph datasets. The results show that PrivAGM outperforms the stateof-the-art methods, generating synthetic graphs with significantly higher utility.",

    "abstract": "Learned Cost Model s ( LCM s) have shown superior results over traditional database cost models as they can significantly improve the accuracy of cost predictions. However,  LCM s still fail for some query plans, as prediction errors can be large in the tail. Unfortunately, recent  LCM s are based on complex deep ne ural models, and thus, there is no easy way to understand where this accuracy drop is rooted, which critically prevents systematic troubleshooting. In this demo paper, we present the very first approach for opening the black box by bringing AI explainability approaches to  LCM s. As a core contribution, we developed new explanation techniques that extend existing methods that are available for the general explainability of AI models and adapt them significantly to be usable for  LCM s. In our demo, we provide an interactive tool to showcase how explainability for  LCM s works. We believe this is a first step for making  LCM s debuggable and thus paving the road for new approaches for systematically fixing problems in LCMs.",

    "title": "A Systematic Study on Early Stopping Metrics in HPO and the Implications of Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "The development of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms is an important topic within both the machine learning and data management domains. While numerous strategies employing early stopping mechanisms have been proposed to bolster HPO e!ciency, there remains a notable deffciency in understanding how the selection of early stopping metrics inffuences the reliability of early stopping decisions and, by extension, the broader HPO outcomes. This paper undertakes a systematic exploration of the impact of metric selection on the effectiveness of early stopping-based HPO. Specifically, we introduce a set of metrics that incorporate uncertainty and highlight their practical significance in enhancing the reliability of early stopping decisions. Our empirical experiments on HPO and NAS benchmarks show that using training loss as an early stopping metric in the early training stages improves HPO outcomes by up to 24.76% compared to the more widely accepted validation loss. Furthermore, integrating uncertainty into the metric yields an additional improvement of up to 4% under budget constraints, translating into meaningful resource savings and scalability benefits in large-scale HPO scenarios. These findings demonstrate the critical role of metric selection while shedding light on the potential implications of integrating uncertainty as a metric. This research provides empirical insights that serve as a compass for the selection and formulation of metrics, thereby contributing to a more profound comprehension of mechanisms underpinning early stopping-based HPO.",

    "abstract": "The integration of tabular data from diverse sources is often hindered by inconsistencies in formatting and representation, posing significant challenges for data analysts and personal digital assistants. Existing methods for automating tabular data transformations are limited in scope, often focusing on specific types of transformations or lacking interpretability. In this paper, we introduce TabulaX, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-class column-level tabular transformations. TabulaX first classifies input columns into four transformation types— string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general—and then applies tailored methods to generate human-interpretable transformation functions, such as numeric formulas or programming code. This approach enhances transparency and allows users to understand and modify the mappings. Through extensive experiments on realworld datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that TabulaX outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, supports a broader class of transformations, and generates interpretable transformations that can be efficiently applied.

    "abstract": "Exploratory data analysis (EDA), coupled with SQL, is essential for data analysts involved in data exploration and analysis. However, data analysts often encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries skillfully and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types that enhance the interpretation of query results. Due to its signiﬁcance, substantial research eﬀorts have been made to explore diﬀerent approaches to address these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements primarily due to (1) complex database schema, (2) unclear user intent, (3) limited cross-domain generalization capability, and (4) insuﬃcient end-to-end text-to-visualization capability. \nThis paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based crossdomain exploratory data analysis system. First, we propose a hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the database schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize across data domains. Second, the EDA system is divided into four components (i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clariﬁcation and decomposition, text-toSQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Finally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a userfriendly GUI in the production environment at PingCAP. We have also open-sourced all APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community. Through extensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight oﬀers remarkable performance compared to human experts. Additionally, TiSQL achieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset when using GPT-4 . It also attains an execution accuracy of 60.98% on the Bird test dataset.",

While previous works on subgraph similarity search used various graph similarity metrics such as the graph isomorphism, graph edit distance, and so on, in this paper, we propose a novel problem, namely  subgraph similarity search under aggregated neighbor difference semantics  (S 3 AND), which identifies subgraphs  𝑔 in a data graph  𝐺 that are similar to a given query graph 𝑞 by considering both keywords and graph structures (under new keyword/structural matching semantics). To efficiently tackle the S 3 AND problem, we design two effective pruning methods,  keyword set  and  aggregated neighbor difference lower bound pruning , which rule out false alarms of candidate vertices/subgraphs to reduce the S 3 AND search space. Furthermore, we construct an effective indexing mechanism to facilitate our proposed efficient S 3 AND query answering algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our S 3 AND approach over both real and synthetic graphs under various parameter settings.",

    "title": "Dynamic Range-Filtering Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search",
    "abstract": "Range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor search ( RFANNS ) has gained significant attention recently. Consider a set  D  of highdimensional vectors, each associated with a numeric attribute value, e.g., price or timestamp. An  RFANNS  query consists of a query vector  𝑞 and a query range, reporting the approximate nearest neighbors of  𝑞 among data vectors whose attributes fall in the query range. Existing work on  RFANNS  only considers a static set D  of data vectors while in many real-world scenarios, vectors arrive in the system in an arbitrary order. This paper studies dynamic RFANNS  where both data vectors and queries arrive in a mixed stream: a query is posed on all the data vectors that have already arrived in the system. Existing work on  RFANNS  is difficult to be extended to the streaming setting as they construct the index in the order of the attribute values while the vectors arrive in the system in an arbitrary order. The main challenge to the dynamic RFANNS  lies in the difference between the two orders. A naive approach to  RFANNS  maintains multiple hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, one for each of the  𝑂 (|D| 2 )  possible query ranges – too expensive to construct and maintain. To design an index structure that can integrate new data vectors with a low index size increment for efficient and effective query processing, we propose a structure called  dynamic segment graph . It compresses the set of HNSW graphs of the naive approach, proven to be lossless under certain conditions, with only a linear to  log  |D|  new edges in expectation when inserting a new vector. This dramatically reduces the index size while largely preserving the search performance. We further propose heuristics to significantly reduce the index cost of our dynamic segment graph in practice. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for static  RFANNS  and is scalable in handling dynamic  RFANNS .",

    "title": "Improving Time Series Data Compression in Apache IoTDB",
    "abstract": "Time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale across various domains. Although traditional compression techniques reduce storage costs, they typically require full decompression before querying, leading to increased latency and higher resource consumption. Homomorphic compression (HC), which enables direct computation on the compressed data without decompression, shows the potential for both reduced storage and improved query performance. However, the unique complexities of time series data pose challenges that current HC methods have yet to adequately address. In this paper, we introduce HC theory in the time series domain, transformatively enabling HC to time series database queries. Building on our theory, we develop  CompressIoTDB  – a novel homomorphic compression framework integrated into Apache IoTDB. By leveraging our proposed CompColumn structure, our framework supports a wide range of query operators, including filtering, aggregation, and window-based functions, all while maintaining data in its compressed form. Furthermore, we incorporate system-level optimizations such as late decompression and dynamic auxiliary management to further boost query efficiency. Extensive experiments show that CompressIoTDB significantly enhances query processing for time series data, achieving an average throughput improvement of 53.4% and memory usage reduction of 20%.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the Number of Distinct Values (NDV) is fundamental for numerous data management tasks, especially within database applications. However, most existing works primarily focus on introducing new statistical or learned estimators, while identifying the most suitable estimator for a given scenario remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose  AdaNDV , a learned method designed to adaptively select and fuse existing estimators to address this issue. Specifically, (1) we propose to use learned models to distinguish between overestimated and underestimated estimators and then select appropriate estimators from each category. This strategy provides a complementary perspective by integrating overestimations and underestimations for error correction, thereby improving the accuracy of NDV estimation. (2) To further integrate the estimation results, we introduce a novel fusion approach that employs a learned model to predict the weights of the selected estimators and then applies a weighted sum to merge them. By combining these strategies, the proposed  AdaNDV  fundamentally distinguishes itself from previous works that directly estimate NDV. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, with the number of individual columns being several orders of magnitude larger than in previous studies, demonstrate the superior performance of our method.",

However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insuffi-duce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results.

Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajecto-(MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a  R oad-aware masking strategy  that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a  spatial-temporal-information of the trajectories.

We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 realworld datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.",

    "abstract": "Community search is a fundamental problem in graph analysis and has attracted much attention for its ability to discover personalized communities. In this paper, we focus on community search over multilayer graphs. We design a novel cohesive subgraph model called synergetic core for multilayer graphs, which requires both local and global cohesiveness. Specifically, the synergetic core man- dates that the vertices within the subgraph are not only densely connected on some individual layers but also form more cohesive connections on the projected graph that considers all layers. The local and global cohesiveness collectively ensure the superiority of the synergetic core. Based on this new model, we formulate the problem of synergetic community search. To efficiently retrieve the community, we propose two algorithms. The first is a progressive search algorithm, which enumerates potential layer combinations to compute the synergetic core. The second is a trie-based search algorithm, leveraging our novel index called dominant layers-based trie (DLT). DLT compactly stores synergetic cores within the trie structure. By traversing the DLT, we can efficiently identify the syn- ergetic core. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) the synergetic core can find communities with the best quality among the state- of-the-art models, and (2) our proposed algorithms are up to five orders of magnitude faster than the basic method.",

    "abstract": "Community search finds query-dependent communities over graphs, which has been investigated broadly. In this work, we focus on the task of returning only a single connected community containing all user input query vertices. Most existing studies in the literature only propose  a single and static model  based on  a particular subgraph (e.g.,  𝑘 -core,  𝑘 -truss, quasi-clique, and learning-based component). These fixed models are hard to find exact community answers on all datasets and fit with different underlying desires of users and queries. This implies that the  community search  task needs human-in-loop  interactions , which allows users to give feedback and dynamically advise community refinement. \nTo tackle the above issues, we formulate and study the problem of  interactive community search , which allows users to add/delete vertices for improving community answers in a few rounds of interactions. We first summarize dozens of existing community models and develop an integrated notation system  M (G ,  M ,  O ,  P) to describe them all. Then, we propose a flexible approach to i nteractive   c ommunity   s earch over  g raphs called  GICS -framework. The successful principle of  GICS -framework lies on three key components:  personalized adding/deleting recommendation ,  parameter auto-tuning , and  fast partial refinement . We develop efficient algorithms and successfully deploy three community models on our  GICS -framework. We further analyze algorithm complexity of  GICS -framework by illustrating one instance model in detail. Extensive experiments on ground-truth communities demonstrate that our interaction of  GICS -framework improves F1-score accuracy by 22% against state-of-the-art competitors, and gives users real-time responses within one second.",

    "abstract": "Query rewrite, which aims to improve query e!ciency by altering an SQL query’s structure without changing its result, has been an important research problem. In order to maintain equivalence between the rewritten query and the original one during rewriting, traditional query rewrite methods always rewrite the queries following certain rewrite rules. However, some problems still remain. First, existing methods of finding the optimal choice or sequence of rewrite rules are still limited and the process always costs a lot of resources. Methods involving discovering new rewrite rules typically require complicated proofs of structural logic or extensive user interactions. Second, current query rewrite methods usually rely highly on DBMS cost estimators which are often not accurate. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel query rewrite method named LLM-R2, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to recommend rewrite rules for a database rewrite system. To further enhance the inference ability of the LLM in recommending rewrite rules, we train a contrastive model using a curriculum-based approach to learn query representations and select effective query demonstrations for the LLM. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the query execution e!ciency and outperforms the baseline methods. In addition, our method exhibits high robustness across different datasets.",

However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex, heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artiﬁcially masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower processing time and signiﬁcantly less training data. When compared against a large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with signiﬁcantly less inference time.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) uses vector databases to expand the expertise of an LLM model without having to retrain it. The idea can be applied over data lakes, leading to the notion of embedding data lakes, i.e., a pool of vector databases ready to be used by RAGs. The key component in these systems is the indexes enabling Approximated Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS). However, in data lakes, one cannot realistically expect to build indexes for every dataset. Thus, we propose an adaptive, partition-based index, CrackIVF, that performs much better than up-front index building. CrackIVF starts answering as a small index, and only expands to improve performance as it sees enough queries. It does so by progressively adapting the index to the query workload. That way, queries can be answered right away without having to build a full index !rst. After seeing enough queries, CrackIVF will produce an index comparable to those built with conventional techniques. CrackIVF can often answer more than 1 million queries before other approaches have even built the index, achieving 10-1000x faster initialization times. This makes it ideal for cold or infrequently used data and as a way to bootstrap access to unseen datasets.",

    "title": "Efficient Historical Butterfly Counting in Large Temporal Bipartite Networks via Graph Structure-aware Index",
    "abstract": "Bipartite graphs are ubiquitous in many domains, e.g., e-commerce platforms, social networks, and academia, by modeling in teractions between distinct entity sets. Within these graphs, the butterfly motif, a complete 2 × 2 biclique, represents the simplest yet significant subgraph structure, crucial for analyzing complex network patterns. Counting the butterflies offers significant benefits across various applications, including community analysis and recommender systems. Additionally, the temporal dimension of bipartite graphs, where edges activate within specific time frames, introduces the concept of historical butterfly counting, i.e., counting butterflies within a given time interval. This temporal analysis sheds light on the dynamics and evolution of network interactions, offering new insights into their mechanisms. Despite its importance, no existing algorithm can efficiently solve the historical butterfly counting task. To address this, we design two novel indices whose memory footprints are dependent on #butterflies and #wedges, respectively. Combining these indices, we propose a graph structure-aware indexing approach that significantly reduces memory usage while preserving exceptional query speed. To further reduce the index size and boost the query efficiency, we design an index compression strategy, enabling the fast, high-quality, and unbiased approximation of historical butterfly counts.

    "title": "Efficient Maintenance of 2-Hop Labeling Index on Dynamic Small-World Graphs",
    "abstract": "2-hop labeling has been widely utilized to accelerate the efficiency of online shortest distance queries. Given the nature of frequent changes in real-world graphs, the efficient maintenance of 2-hop labeling index has been extensively studied recently. However, existing methods cannot efficiently process large-scale graphs due to their high time and memory costs, and most of them process large batches of updates sequentially, significantly decreasing efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for maintaining the 2-hop labeling index in a parallel manner, called  M2HL , which can efficiently handle both edge insertions and deletions. Moreover, we theoretically prove that M2HL maintains both correctness and minimality for the updated 2-hop labeling index. Our experiments on ten large-scale graphs demonstrate that M2HL outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-hop labeling maintenance methods by up to four orders of magnitude in speed while maintaining correctness and minimality, as well as exhibiting strong scalability and low memory usage.",

    "title": "Automatic Indexing in Oracle",
    "abstract": "Indexes are one of the important access structures that help improve database performance. This paper provides a methodology to automate the entire lifecycle of index creation and management with continuous index tuning based on changing data and workload. We present novel ideas that are critical to ensuring automatic indexing seamlessly works in a production database. Our methodology avoids using an expensive clone; yet o!ers non-intrusive index operations (candidate isolation and evaluation with Oracle resource manager ensuring no visible impact to the user workload), and upon deployment of auto indexes ensures non-disruptive plan invalidations and timely mitigation of performance regressions. The proposed approach is unique in that it is incremental and iterative, continually creating beneficial indexes and dropping unused ones as the workload evolves. The approach even supports indexes on expressions. It performs careful validation – including computing overhead of index maintenance incurred during DML while evaluating potential benefit – and provides accountability for its actions. Performance regressions are e!ectively managed using Oracle’s powerful SQL Plan Management (SPM) framework. For example, a new automatic index isn’t dropped in response to a single statement regressing due to it; SPM instead ensures such regressing statements revert to well-performing plans even in the presence of new indexes that continue to benefit other statements. We also share results of comprehensively evaluating various automatic indexing aspects in publicly available and Oracle customer workloads. Our experiments show benefit with automatic indexing, especially in customer workload, with a 15% improvement in performance and 60% space reclamation potential. This automatic indexing feature is available since Oracle 19c and in Oracle Autonomous Database.",

    "title": "Why Are Learned Indexes So Effective but Sometimes Ineffective?",
    "abstract": "Learned indexes have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to offer better space-time trade-offs compared to B+tree variants. Among various learned indexes, the PGM-Index based on error-bounded piecewise linear approximation is an elegant data structure that has demonstrated  provably  superior performance over conventional B+-tree indexes. However, despite numerous efforts to optimize the design of the PGM-Index, few systematically study the root causes of performance mismatches observed in practice. In this paper, we explore two key research questions. Q1 :  Why are PGM-Indexes theoretically effective?  and  Q2 :  Why do PGM-Indexes underperform in practice?  For  Q1 , we show that for a set of  𝑁 sorted keys, the PGM-Index can achieve a lookup time of  𝑂 ( log log  𝑁 )  while using  𝑂(𝑁)  space. For  Q2 , we identify that querying PGM-Indexes is highly memory-bound, where the internal index search operations often become the bottleneck. To fill the performance gap, we propose PGM++, a  simple yet effective extension to the original PGM-Index that employs a mixture of different search strategies, with hyper-parameters automatically tuned through a cost model calibrated by theoretical findings. Extensive experiments show that, at comparable space costs, PGM++ speeds up index lookup queries by up to  2.31 ×  and  1.56 ×  when compared to the original PGM-Index and SOTA baselines.",

Transfers often occur across heterogeneous environments—ranging from cloud-hosted systems to local consumer devices—with varying compute and network constraints. However, existing solutions struggle to balance performance with generality across such diverse setups. We recently proposed XDBC, a holistic data transfer framework that decomposes the pipeline into logical components with multiple physical implementations per component. Its modular architecture enables seamless system integration and automatic tuning based on workload and environment characteristics. In this demonstration, we present Enter the Warp, an interactive game built around XDBC that visualizes data transfer as a space mission.

    "title": "Unraveling the Impact of Window Semantics: Optimizing Join Order for Efficient Stream Processing",
    "abstract": "Window joins (WJs) are fundamental operators in stream processing systems (SPSs), enabling continuous, time-aware joins over unbounded data streams. Unlike time-agnostic relational joins, WJs incorporate temporal semantics associated with different window types (i.e., sliding, session, and interval windows), which introduce uncertainty in algebraic properties such as commutativity and associativity. As a result, state-of-the-art SPSs exploit only a single, fixed join order, which limits optimization opportunities and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we eliminate this restriction by introducing three transformation rules that enable WJ reordering while preserving query semantics for those window types. Based on them, we propose  WJR , an algorithm that systematically enumerates semantically equivalent join orders, expanding the search space for finding efficient WJ execution plans. Our evaluation shows speedups of up to 10 for multi-way WJ queries under various window configurations and rate ratios, highlighting the performance benefits of flexible join reordering in streaming queries.",

    "title": "EVOSCHEMA: TOWARDS TEXT-TO-SQL ROBUSTNESS AGAINST SCHEMA EVOLUTION",
    "abstract": "Neural text-to-SQL models, which translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SQL queries given a database schema, have achieved remarkable performance. However, database schemas frequently evolve to meet new requirements. Such schema evolution often leads to performance degradation for models trained on static schemas. Existing work either mainly focuses on simply paraphrasing some syntactic or semantic mappings among NLQ, DB and SQL, or lacks a comprehensive and controllable way to investigate the model robustness issue under the schema evolution, which is insufficient when facing the increasingly complex and rich database schema changes in reality, especially in the LLM era. \nTo address the challenges posed by schema evolution, we present EvoSchema , a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance the robustness of text-to-SQL systems under real-world schema changes.  EvoSchema  introduces a novel schema evolution taxonomy, encompassing ten perturbation types across columnlevel and table-level modifications, systematically simulating the dynamic nature of database schemas. Through  EvoSchema , we conduct an in-depth evaluation spanning different open-source and closed-source LLMs, revealing that table-level perturbations have a significantly greater impact on model performance compared to column-level changes. Furthermore,  EvoSchema  inspires the development of more resilient text-to-SQL systems, in terms of both model training and database design. The models trained on EvoSchema ’s diverse schema designs can force the model to distinguish the schema difference for the same questions to avoid learning spurious patterns, which demonstrate remarkable robustness compared to those trained on unperturbed data on average. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model behavior and a path forward for designing systems capable of thriving in dynamic, real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Vector search systems are indispensable in large language model (LLM) serving, search engines, and recommender systems, where minimizing online search latency is essential. Among various algorithms, graph-based vector search (GVS) is particularly popular due to its high search performance and quality. However, reducing GVS latency by intra-query parallelization remains challenging due to limitations imposed by both existing hardware architectures (CPUs and GPUs) and the inherent difficulty of parallelizing graph traversals. To efficiently serve low-latency GVS, we co-design hardware and algorithm by proposing Falcon and Delayed-Synchronization Traversal (DST). Falcon is a hardware GVS accelerator that implements efficient GVS operators, pipelines these operators, and reduces memory accesses by tracking search states with an onchip Bloom filter. DST is an efficient graph traversal algorithm that simultaneously improves search performance and quality by relaxing traversal orders to maximize accelerator utilization. Evaluation across various graphs and datasets shows that Falcon, prototyped on FPGAs, together with DST, achieves up to 4.3 ×  and 19.5 ×  lower latency and up to 8.0 ×  and 26.9 ×  improvements in energy efficiency over CPU- and GPU-based GVS systems.",

    "abstract": "Data transformation poses significant challenges due to the wide diversity in input data formats and different requirements. Existing approaches—including human-driven, algorithmic, and large language model (LLM)-based solutions—each exhibits trade-offs in terms of cost, accuracy, and the range of supported transformations. To address these limitations, we propose  MegaTran , a novel framework for generating accurate and cost-effective data transformation code.  MegaTran  employs a two-stage process:  Weak2StrongPrompt , which converts a user’s weak prompt (a loosely specified user input) into a strong, structured prompt, and  Prompt2Code , which generates transformation code based on this refined prompt. In Weak2StrongPrompt , a fine-tuned lightweight LLM predicts the transformation type and generates a detailed task description from the user’s input. In  Prompt2Code , a powerful LLM generates the corresponding transformation code, guided by two key optimizations: (1)  Sanity-check Reflection with checklist , which iteratively debugs and refines the code by addressing errors; and (2)  LazyRAG , a retrieval-augmented generation technique that retrieves relevant code snippets or documentation from external resources ( e.g.,  GitHub, DataPrep) to enhance code quality.

    "title": "Most Similar Biclique Search at Scale",
    "abstract": "The biclique is a fundamental model of bipartite cohesive subgraphs. To analyze a bipartite graph, many existing works seek the maximum biclique, that is, the biclique with the largest number of edges. However, our finding is that the  most similar biclique  (i.e., the biclique whose vertices are the most similar to each other) can be a good alternative for understanding the network. Using the model, we can detect meaningful communities with high similarity and avoid unnecessary searches based on vertex similarity. In particular, we aim to find (i)  local most similar biclique : the biclique that contains a query node  𝑞 and the similarity between vertices is the highest, and (ii)  global most similar biclique : the biclique with the highest similarity between vertices. \nDespite the NP-hardness of the problems, this paper presents two efficient algorithms,  Mosib  and  Mosib-GloApp . Specifically, our Mosib  is an exact algorithm for the most similar biclique search. The algorithm incorporates three novel graph reduction rules that can reduce the size of the bipartite graph while preserving the most similar biclique, as well as two similarity-first search rules that can prioritize the bicliques with high similarity in the search. These techniques can significantly improve the practical efficiency of the algorithm. Meanwhile, our  Mosib-GloApp  is an approximate algorithm that adopts a novel MinHash-based dividing method, and it can further improve the efficiency of the global most similar biclique search. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms on realworld networks, and show that the most similar biclique models can find meaningful results while being computed efficiently.",

    "title": "Efficient 𝑘-Clique Densest Subgraph Discovery: Towards Bridging Practice and Theory",
    "abstract": "Densest subgraph discovery (DSD)  is a fundamental topic in graph mining. It has been studied for decades, and is widely used in various areas, including network science, biological analysis, and graph database s. As a typical problem of DSD, the  𝑘 -clique densest subgraph (CDS) problem aims to detect a subgraph from a graph, such that the number of  𝑘 -cliques over the number of its vertices is maximized. While the CDS problem has received plenty of attention in the literature, existing CDS algorithms that perform best in practice often have weaker theoretical guarantees, while those with the stronger theoretical assurances tend to perform worse in practice. Besides, all the existing CDS algorithms struggle with graphs with high degeneracy values, a characteristic commonly found in real-world graphs. To bridge the huge gap between practice and theory, in this paper, we first introduce a novel graph reduction technique, which locates the CDS into a very small subgraph, with non-trivial theoretical guarantees. We further propose a new efficient approximation algorithm by employing the state-of-the-art 𝑘 -clique counting algorithm, which shares all the advantages of existing algorithms, achieving both strong practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world large graphs demonstrate the high efficiency of our CDS algorithm. Particularly, our algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm while maintaining the same accuracy guarantees and requiring much less memory.",

    "abstract": "In many applications, from university rankings to the selection of candidates for a job interview, there exist various “reasonable” ways to filter the data and generate a ranking. When the initial choice lacks certain desirable properties, we want to identify a minimally modified alternative that has those properties. To this end, we demonstrate  GooseDB , a database engine that combines DuckDB with an MILP solver. Given an SQL query, constraints on the output, and modification preferences,  GooseDB  returns a minimally modified SQL query that satisfies the constraints. This demo focuses on representation constraints for top- 𝑘 queries, i.e., count constraints over groups of tuples, such as the gender distribution of the top- 𝑘 job candidates.  GooseDB  significantly generalizes previous work in two directions. First, it supports more general modifications of the selection condition and the scoring function. Second, it is the first solution to holistically optimize for both at the same time, as well as for alternative values of limit  𝑘 . Conference attendees will be able to interactively refine queries from easy-to-understand applications, observing the impact of their choices.",

    "abstract": "With the breakthrough of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the demand for fine-tuning (FT) to adapt the base pre-trained models to downstream applications continues to grow, so it is essential for service providers to reduce the cost of processing FT requests. Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base model unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by jointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model. \nNevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT is dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data — the sequence length variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop  LobRA , a brand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly training LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly,  LobRA  deploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous resource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads caused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,  LobRA  takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training data among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We conduct experiments to assess the performance of  LobRA , validating that it significantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.",

    "title": "Design and Modular Verification of Distributed Transactions in MongoDB",
    "abstract": "MongoDB’s distributed multi-document transactions protocol was designed and developed incrementally, building on WiredTiger, an existing single node multi-version storage engine that provided snapshot isolated key-value storage. This layered approach required meticulous management of concurrency control and timestamping mechanisms across system layers, complicated by intricate component interactions and a large evolving codebase. In this paper, we describe our experience using  modular  formal speciﬁcation techniques to address this challenge. Our approach formally speciﬁes the distributed transactions protocol and its interface with the underlying storage layer, allowing us to verify high level protocol properties while also formalizing the contract between these two components. This modular approach also enables an automated, model-based veriﬁcation technique for testing conformance of the WiredTiger storage implementation to this interface. We use an explicit state model checker to automatically generate test cases from our storage model, which are then executed against the storage implementation, ensuring the implementation matches the interface relied upon by the transactions protocol. Our work highlights the value of formal modeling not only for verifying high-level protocol correctness but also for precisely deﬁning and validating interactions with lower-level system components in an automated way. Beyond verifying key isolation properties, our speciﬁcation also enabled us to formally analyze  permissiveness –how well the protocol maximizes concurrency within a given isolation level–a property not previously examined.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, plays a crucial role in enabling non-experts to interact with databases. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text-to-SQL performance, existing approaches face notable limitations in real-world text-to-SQL applications. Prompting-based methods often depend on closed-source LLMs, which are expensive, raise privacy concerns, and lack customization. Fine-tuning-based methods, on the other hand, suffer from poor generalizability due to the limited coverage of publicly available training data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and scalable text-to-SQL data synthesis framework for automatically synthesizing large-scale, high-quality, and diverse datasets without extensive human intervention. Using this framework, we introduce  SynSQL-2.5M , the first million-scale text-to-SQL dataset, containing 2.5 million samples spanning over 16,000 synthetic databases. Each sample includes a database, SQL query, natural language question, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solution. Leveraging  SynSQL-2.5M , we develop  OmniSQL , a powerful open-source text-to-SQL model available in three sizes: 7B, 14B, and 32B. Extensive evaluations across nine datasets demonstrate that  OmniSQL  achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing leading closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, despite its smaller size. We release all code, datasets, and models to support further research.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies investigated the challenge of assessing the strength of a given claim extracted from a dataset, particularly the claim’s potential of being misleading and cherry-picked. We focus on claims that compare answers to an aggregate query posed on a view that selects tuples. The strength of a claim amounts to the question of how likely it is that the view is carefully chosen to support the claim, whereas less careful choices would lead to contradictory claims. We embark on the study of the reverse task that offers a complementary angle in the critical assessment of data-based claims: given a claim, find useful supporting views. The goal of this task is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to assist users in finding significant evidence of phenomena of interest. On the other hand, we wish to provide them with machinery to criticize or counter given claims by extracting evidence of opposing statements. \nTo be effective, the supporting sub-population should be signifi-To be effective, the supporting sub-population should be significant and defined by a “natural” view. We discuss several measures of naturalness and propose ways of extracting the best views under each measure (and combinations thereof). The main challenge is the computational cost, as naïve search is infeasible. We devise anytime algorithms that deploy two main steps: (1) a preliminary construction of a ranked list of attribute combinations that are as-construction of a ranked list of attribute combinations that are assessed using fast-to-compute features, and (2) an efficient search for the actual views based on each attribute combination. We present a thorough experimental study that shows the effectiveness of our algorithms in terms of quality and execution cost. We also present a user study to assess the usefulness of the naturalness measures.",

    "title": "TMLKD: Few-shot Trajectory Metric Learning via Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Trajectory metric learning, which supports the trajectory similarity search, is one of the most fundamental tasks in spatial-temporal data analysis. However, existing trajectory metric learning methods rely on massive labels of pairwise trajectory distance, and thus cannot be applied to few-shot scenarios frequently occurring in real-world applications. Though performance drops caused by insuﬃcient labels can be alleviated by knowledge distillation, we demonstrate that they cannot be directly applied to few-shot trajectory metric learning due to the domain shift problem. To this end, this paper proposes invariant and relaxed learning enhanced knowledge distillation method TMLKD for few-shot trajectory metric learning, such that domain-invariant representation and rank knowledge can be distilled. Speciﬁcally, in the representation learning phase, it ﬁrst employs an adversarial sub-network to distinguish domain-speciﬁc and domain-invariant information, so as to distill transferable representation knowledge from teacher models. To mitigate the few-shot problem in student model training, we further enrich sparse labels of the target domain by utilizing the rank knowledge revealed in teachers’ predictions. Particularly, TMLKD employs a list-wise learning-to-rank approach to learn the relaxed trajectory ranking orders instead of focusing on all the samples inefﬁciently. Finally, to guide accurate distillation, we adaptively assign reliability of teacher prediction by utilizing the ground-truth labels, to avoid misleading the student model with low-quality teacher predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.",

    "abstract": "The semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems either empirically optimize expensive LLM-powered operations with  no performance guarantees , or limit their support to simple batched-inference primitives. We introduce  semantic operators , the rst formalism with statistical accuracy guarantees for general-purpose AI-based operations with natural language parameters (e.g., ltering, sorting, joining or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator can be implemented by multiple  AI algorithms , which compose individual model invocations to orchestrate the model over the data. Our programming model species the expected behavior of each operator with a high-quality  reference algorithm , and we develop an optimization framework that reduces cost, while providing accuracy guarantees for individual operators. Using this approach, we propose several novel optimizations to accelerate semantic ltering, joining, group-by and top-k operations by up to 1 ,  000 ⇥ . We implement semantic operators in the LOTUS system and demonstrate LOTUS’ eectiveness on real, bulk-semantic processing applications, including fact-checking, biomedical multilabel classication, search, and topic analysis. We show that the semantic operator model is expressive, capturing state-of-the-art AI pipelines in a few operator calls, and making it easy to express new pipelines that match or exceed quality of recent LLM-based analytic systems by up to 170%, while oering accuracy guarantees. Overall, LOTUS programs match or exceed the accuracy of state-ofthe-art AI pipelines for each task while running up to 3 . 6 ⇥ faster than the highest-quality baselines.

    "abstract": "Although a large amount of valuable knowledge can be obtained from the weighted graph snapshots modeled over time, it may cause privacy issues. Local differential privacy (LDP) provides a strong solution for private graph data publishing in decentralized networks. However, most existing LDP studies over graphs are only applicable to static unweighted graphs. This paper investigates the problem of continuous publication of weighted graph snapshots and proposes a graph publication framework, WGT-LDP, under 𝑤-event edge weight LDP, which can protect the privacy of edges and weights over any  𝑤 consecutive time steps. WGT-LDP consists of four key components: population division-based sampling that overcomes the problem of over-segmentation of the privacy budget, data range estimation that mitigates noise on edge weights, aggregate information collection that obtains important information about the graph structure and edge weights, and graph snapshot generation that reconstructs weighted graph snapshot at each time step. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and utility, and perform extensive experiments on three real-world and two synthetic datasets, using four commonly used metrics. Our experiments show that WGT-LDP produces high-quality synthetic weighted graphs and significantly outperforms baseline methods.",

    "title": "Infinite Stream Estimation under Personalized 𝑤-Event Privacy",
    "abstract": "Streaming data collection is indispensable for stream data analysis, such as event monitoring. However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy leaks.  𝑤 -event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy within a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection. Most existing 𝑤 -event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on homogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose personalized  𝑤 -event privacy protection that allows different users to have different privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically, we design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy requirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism (PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data statistics while achieving 𝒘 -Event  𝝐 -Personalized Differential Privacy (( 𝒘 , 𝝐 )-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution (PBD) and Personalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the same privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the previous release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous  𝑘 time slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next  𝑘 time slots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that both PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic datasets, compared with the recent uniformity  𝑤 -event approaches, Budget Distribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error than BD on average on real datasets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24 . 9% less error than BA on average on synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning models capture the semantics of complex data by transforming them into high-dimensional embedding vectors. Emerging applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation, use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in the embedding vector space to find similar data. Existing vector databases provide indexes for efficient ANN searches, with graph-based indexes being the most popular due to their low latency and high recall in real-world high-dimensional datasets. However, these indexes are costly to build, suffer from significant contention under concurrent read-write workloads, and scale poorly to multiple servers. \nOur goal is to build a vector database that achieves high throughput and high recall under concurrent read-write workloads. To this end, we first propose an ANN index with an explicit two-stage design combining a fast filter stage with highly compressed vectors and a refine stage to ensure recall, and we devise a novel lightweight machine learning technique to fine-tune the index parameters. We introduce an early termination check to dynamically adapt the search process for each query. Next, we add support for writes while maintaining search performance by decoupling the management of the learned parameters. Finally, we design HAKES, a distributed vector database that serves the new index in a disaggregated architecture. We evaluate our index and system against 12 state-of-the-art indexes and three distributed vector databases, using high-dimensional embedding datasets generated by deep learning models. The experimental results show that our index outperforms index baselines in the high recall region and under concurrent read-write workloads. Furthermore,  HAKES  is scalable and achieves up to 16 ×  higher throughputs than the baselines.",

    "title": "Suna: Scalable Causal Confounder Discovery over Relational Data",
    "abstract": "Understanding the causal relationships between treatments and outcomes is fundamental in various areas. Causal inference aims to estimate the eﬀect of one variable on another, and critically relies on access to those variables as well as the key confounders. Unfortunately, data analysts often start with datasets lacking these columns, leading to incorrect estimations. Relational data repositories hold signiﬁcant potential to augment such datasets with an admissible set of confounders necessary for causal analysis. While recent work has advocated for this potential, these approaches face notable limitations. They either assume the existence of a complete causal diagram over all datasets in the repository, which is impractical; rely on computationally infeasible techniques that do not scale to large data repositories with many features; or can only detect confounders in the absence of causal relations, and are thus ineﬀective when a causal eﬀect exists. \nWe observe that the asymmetry between causes and eﬀects used in causal discovery can be exploited to directly identify confounders for causal queries. In this paper, we establish a connection between the existence of confounders and the presence of unconfounded ancestors of the treatment variable in the underlying causal diagram—without requiring access to the diagram. This makes it feasible to iteratively discover confounders until an admissible set is constructed. We propose  Suna , a highly optimized, GPU-compatible system that implements a novel end-to-end algorithm for discovering confounders within large relational data repositories. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our system eﬀectively discovers high-quality confounders. Furthermore,  Suna  employs algorithmic optimizations to accelerate confounder discovery without materializing joins. Our experiments show that  Suna  ﬁnds high-quality confounders while running >100x faster than existing confounder discovery systems.",

Various ways have been proposed to impose constraints on the elected committee. The demonstration presents DVote— a tool that implements a recent framework for extending score-based ABC voting with constraints on the context surrounding the candidates, given as a relational database. DVote provides a convenient interface to set up a voting instance and build contextual constraints in the form of Tuple-Generating Dependencies (TGDs) and Denial Constraints (DCs).

    "abstract": "We propose a theory that can determine the lowest isolation level that can be allocated to each transaction program in an application in a mixed-isolation-level setting, to guarantee that all executions will be serializable and thus preserve all integrity constraints, even those that are not explicitly declared. This extends prior work applied to completely known transactions, to deal with the realistic situation where transactions are generated by running programs with parameters that are not known in advance. Using our theory, we propose an optimization method that allows for high throughput while ensuring that all executions are serializable. Our method is based on searching for application code modifications that are semantics-preserving while improving the isolation level allocation. We illustrate our approach to the SmallBank benchmark.",

    "title": "Triparts: Scalable Streaming Graph Partitioning to Enhance Community Structure",
    "abstract": "k-way edge based partitioning algorithms for processing large streaming graphs, such as social networks and web crawls, assign each arriving edge to one of the k partitions. This can result in vertices being replicated on multiple partitions. Typically, such partitioning algorithms aim to balance the edge counts across partitions while minimizing the vertex replication. However, such objectives ignore the community structure inherently embedded in the graph, which is an important quality metric for clustering and graph mining applications that subsequently operate on the partitions. To address this gap, we propose a novel optimization goal to maximize the number of local triangles in the partitions as an additional objective. Triangle count is an eﬀective metric to measure the conservation of community structure. Further, we propose TriParts a family of heuristics for online partitioning over an edge stream. They use three complementary state data structures: Bloom Filters, Triangle Map and High degree Map. Each state adds tangible value to meet our objectives. We validate TriParts on six diverse real world graphs with up to 1.6B edges and varying triangle densities. Our best heuristic outperforms the state-of-the-art DBH and HDRF streaming graph partitioners on the triangle-count metric by up to 4-8.3x while maintaining competitive vertex replication factor and edge-balancing. We achieve an ingest rate of 500k edges/sec on a 16 node cluster. We also oﬀer detailed results on the conﬁguration parameters, scalability and overheads of TriParts, and its practical beneﬁts for distributed graph analytics.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic Approximation , a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms time series into discrete symbols, has gained increasing attention in various downstream applications. Despite decades of development, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive study in this domain, highlighting a need for more in-depth investigation and well-designed exploration tools. To address this gap, we propose  SAIL , a modular web engine serving two purposes: (i) to provide the first comprehensive study on 7 state-of-the-art methods over 100+ time-series datasets, the largest study in this area; (ii) to evaluate the performance of a recently proposed solution, SPARTAN, that solves two core problems. First, SPARTAN exploits intrinsic dimensionality reduction to effectively model the underlying data distribution for approximation. Second, SPARTAN dynamically allocates alphabet sizes per segment, recognizing the non-uniform distribution of information in practice. Through its interactive interface, SAIL enables users to visualize and explore quantitative assessments across various methods, datasets, and analytical tasks. SAIL’s exploration reveals that (i) while SAX variants outperform SAX by sacrificing storage, none surpass SAX under the same budget, reinforcing it as a strong baseline; SFA is the only existing method that consistently outperforms SAX within the same budget; and (ii) across diverse scenarios, SPARTAN outperforms competing methods in all evaluated tasks significantly, including classification, clustering, indexing, and anomaly detection, without incurring additional storage or runtime overhead. Overall, SAIL not only facilitates the most comprehensive studies in this field but also provides new insights and concrete solutions for future research. We release the SAIL web engine at https://saildemo.streamlit.app/.",

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a foundational yet computationally demanding query in vector databases, critical for applications such as information retrieval and generative AI inference. Hierarchical graph-based methods have attracted signiﬁcant attention due to their promising query performances compared to other indexes for ANN search. However, these methods still face eﬃciency bottlenecks because they rely on exhaustive and level-bylevel traversals within hierarchical graphs. This paper introduces SHG , a novel hierarchical graph-based index that enhances search eﬃciency by bypassing intermediate and redundant levels. Speciﬁcally,  SHG  leverages a hierarchical vector compression method to reduce the time spent on distance computations, and employs a new data structure called shortcuts to determine the number of intermediate levels that can be safely skipped. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our solution achieves 1.5–1.8 ×  speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our method signiﬁcantly improves the robustness of ANN search, boosting recall by up to 20% for certain queries on benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Query Performance Prediction (QPP) is the task of predicting the query runtime performance prior to its execution. While QPP has been studied in relational database systems, it has received little attention for RDF stores, i.e., triplestores that are queried via the SPARQL query language. Existing methods predict the query performance based on the syntactic similarity between a given query and past queries in the query logs. This means that they are not able to generalize to unseen queries with unseen structures or characteristics. We propose a novel GCNN architecture, PlanRGCN, to generalize to unseen queries, fully exploit statistics on the stored KG, and offer more scalable pre-training than the state of the art methods. Furthermore, our architecture is the first to support nontrivial SPARQL operators. In our experiments, we demonstrate both the superior robustness of our prediction method and its practical effect on two downstream tasks: (1) load balancing, achieving a throughput improvement of up to 207% on real-world query logs and (2) execution control, processing up to 70% more queries.",

    "abstract": "Modern computing systems, such as HDFS and Spark, produce vast quantities of logs that developers use for tasks like anomaly detection and error analysis. To simplify log analysis, template generation methods have been proposed to standardize log formats, transforming unstructured data into structured templates. Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods suffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics or specific log patterns in training sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation. However, they often struggle with ambiguous, complex, or highly specific log content, which can lead to errors in generating accurate templates. To address these challenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive in-context learning. We first propose an edit-distance-based similarity metric to evaluate log similarity. Then, we introduce a method to select the most informative  𝑘 unlabeled logs for annotation by considering both the representativeness of the logs and the confidence of LLM predictions. Additionally, we design an adaptive context selection strategy that adaptively selects labeled logs to ensure comprehensive keyword coverage for unlabeled logs. These labeled logs serve as the context for LLMs to better understand the unlabeled logs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of template generation. Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate that LLMLog outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Provexa  introduces an expressive domain-specific language,  ProvQL , that offers essential primitives for various types of attack analyses (e.g., attack pattern search, attack dependency tracking) with user-defined constraints, enabling analysts to focus on attack-relevant parts and iteratively sift through the large provenance data.

    "abstract": "In the era of big data, the demand for historical data analytics is growing across various applications. Simultaneously, range queries have been extensively explored within the domain of databases. Binary search trees are a classic type of in-memory index for facilitating range queries. Persistent binary search trees provide read-only snapshots of these trees, allowing range queries to be processed during updates while ensuring consistency. Additionally, multiple versions of snapshots support queries related to historical moments to meet the demands of numerous applications.\nHowever, existing implementations do not support both high-speed updates and efficient, accurate historical queries on multicore platforms. Motivated by this gap, we propose a novel concurrent update strategy to balance update and query performance. For a binary search tree containing 𝑛 elements, our approach completes 𝑚 updates in O (log 𝑛 + 𝑚) time using O (log 𝑛) threads. We further implement a hybrid concurrent strategy to improve the scalability and practical performance of our solution.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our proposal strikes a good balance between update and query performance. In particular, our proposal outperforms existing solutions under workloads with different data distributions and varying update-query ratios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce  DobLIX , a dual-objective learned index (LI) specifically designed for Log-Structured Merge (LSM) treebased key-value stores. Traditional LIs primarily focus on optimizing index lookups, often overlooking the critical role of data access from storage, which can become a significant performance bottleneck. In LSM-based systems, a considerable portion of the index is stored on disk, making lookups highly dependent on the efficient coordination between in-memory structures and disk-resident data. Poorly optimized access patterns can lead to excessive I/O operations, negatively impacting read latency and overall system performance.  DobLIX  addresses this by incorporating a second objective, data access optimization, into the LI training process. This dual-objective approach ensures that both index lookup efficiency and data access costs are minimized, leading to significant improvements in read performance while maintaining write efficiency in real-world LSM systems. Additionally,  DobLIX  features a reinforcement learning agent that dynamically tunes the system parameters, allowing it to adapt to varying workloads in real-time. Experimental results using real-world datasets demonstrate that  DobLIX  reduces indexing overhead and improves throughput by 1 . 19 ×  to 2 . 21 × compared to state-of-the-art methods within RocksDB, a widely used LSM-based storage engine.",

    "title": "ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveragin g their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series and Time Series Evol-Instruct to generates diverse Q&As for enhanced reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the !rst MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is !ne-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS signi!cantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Cloud-native database systems with multi-primary shared-storage architecture have emerged due to their superior performance over primary-secondary architecture on write-intensive workload scenarios. However, these systems face performance degradation as the proportion of shared data increases, adversely affecting their CostPerformance Ratio (CPR). In this paper, we identify frequent page ownership transfers between primaries as a key factor contributing to these performance bottlenecks. To address this challenge, we propose  Chimera , a multi-primary database system that employs a two-phase transaction scheduling mechanism, combined with a delay-fetch ownership transfer strategy to effectively reduce the overhead of ownership transfers. Extensive experiments on SmallBank and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that  Chimera outperforms existing schedule methods for multi-primary systems, achieving performance gains of 1.86 × ∼ 19.03 ×  on throughput.",

    "abstract": "Large organizations emit terabytes of logs every day in their cloud environment. Efficient data science on these logs via text search is crucial for gleaning operational insights and debugging production outages. Current log management systems either perform full-text indexing on a cluster of dedicated servers to provide efficient search at the expense of high storage cost, or store unindexed compressed logs on object storage at the expense of high search cost. \nWe propose LogCloud, a new object-storage based log management system that supports both cheap compressed log storage and efficient search. LogCloud constructs inverted indices on compressed logs using a novel FM-index implementation that supports efficient querying from object storage directly, removing the need for dedicated indexing servers. Experiments on five public and five production log datasets show that LogCloud can achieve both cheap storage and search, scaling to TB-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "Late Materialization (LM) is a critical technique applied in traditional column stores to speed up analytical queries. However, with modern analytical databases evolved to incorporate a vectorized columnar execution engine, LM’s benefits in I/O reduction and fast columnar query processing have diminished. In this paper, we redefine the concept of Late Materialization in the context of modern analytical databases and propose Selective Late Materialization (SLM) to allow each attribute in a query to choose its own materialization point that yields the minimum cost. SLM expands the solution space of the traditional materialization problem from one unified hard-coded binary decision (i.e., early or late) for all attributes to per attribute per query decisions. By integrating SLM into DuckDB, we show that SLM consistently outperforms the baselines of Early Materialization and Late Materialization by 14.7% and 8.9%, respectively, on average using the Join Order Benchmark (JOB), with up to 76.7% latency reduction for individual queries. We observe similar results for the TPC-DS benchmark.",

    "abstract": "The blossom algorithm computes maximum matchings in graphs and has been widely applied across diverse domains, including machine learning, economic analysis, and other essential data analytics applications. As data scales and the demand for real-time processing intensifies, high-performance computing solutions have become indispensable. Over the years, substantial research efforts have been dedicated to improving the sequential blossom algorithm. However, developing an efficient parallel solution remains highly challenging due to the algorithm’s intricate execution patterns, sequential recursive dependencies, dynamic data structure modifications, and inefficient path search. \nBy thoroughly analyzing existing solutions, we have identified critical issues and proposed a new parallel framework called XBlossom. This framework eliminates recursion entirely, enables efficient searches for multiple disjoint paths, and employs a simple path table to trace paths, removing the need for dynamic graphs and trees. These efforts in algorithm development result in significant performance enhancement. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that X-Blossom outperforms all existing solutions, achieving up to 992x speedup compared to the fastest sequential baseline, and an average of 431x speedup over the state-of-theart parallel solution using 8 cores. It also demonstrates excellent scalability, achieving an average speedup of 1.72x when threads double in scalability tests to 64 cores. To the best of our knowledge, X-Blossom is the fastest solution for this class of graph algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Line Density Visualization (LDV) is an important operation of geospatial analysis, which has been extensively used in many application domains, e.g., urban planning, criminology, and transportation science. However, LDV is computationally demanding. Therefore, existing exact solutions are not scalable (or even not feasible) to support large-scale datasets and high resolution sizes for generating LDV. To handle the efficiency issues, we develop the first solution to approximately compute LDV with an 𝜖-relative error guarantee, which consists of two main parts. First, we develop the new indexing structure, called length-aggregation-based grid structure (LARGE). Second, based on LARGE, we develop two types of fast bound functions, namely (1) square-shaped lower and upper bound functions and (2) arbitrary-shaped lower and upper bound functions, which can filter a large portion of unnecessary computations. By theoretically analyzing the tightness of our bound functions and experimentally comparing our solution with existing exact solutions on four large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our solution can be scalable to generate high-resolution LDVs using large-scale datasets. In particular, our solution achieves up to 291.8x speedups over the state-of-the-art solutions.",

In this paper, we first summarize a unified framework to incorporate all DSD algorithms from a highlevel perspective. We then extensively compare representative DSD algorithms over a range of graphs – from small to billion-scale – and examine the effectiveness of all methods, providing a thorough analysis of DSD algorithms. As a byproduct of our experimental analysis, we are also able to identify new variants of the DSD algorithms over undirected graphs, by combining existing techniques, which are up to 10 × faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm with the same accuracy guarantee.

    "abstract": "𝑘-defective clique is a relaxation of the well-studied clique structure, by allowing up-to 𝑘 edges missing from a clique. The problem of finding a 𝑘-defective clique with the largest number of vertices, although being NP-hard, has been receiving increasing interests recently, with advancements in both the theoretical time complexity and practical efficiency. The state-of-the-art time complexity is O∗(𝛾ⁿₖ), where O∗ ignores polynomial factors, 𝑛 is the number of 𝑘 vertices in the input graph 𝐺, and 𝛾ₖ < 2 is a constant that only depends on 𝑘. In this paper, we first prove, through a more refined and non-trivial analysis, that the time complexity of an existing algorithm can actually bebounded by O∗(𝛾𝑛 ),where 𝛾ₖ₋₁ <𝛾ₖ. 𝑘−1Then, by utilizing the diameter-two property of large 𝑘-defective cliques, we show that for graphs with maximum 𝑘-defective clique sizes 𝜔𝑘(𝐺) ≥ 𝑘 + 2, a maximum 𝑘-defective clique can be found in O∗((𝛼Δ)ᵏ⁺²𝛾ᵅₖ₋₁ ) time when using the degeneracy parameteri- 𝑘−1 zation 𝛼 and in O∗((𝛼Δ)ᵏ⁺²(𝑘 + 1)𝛼+k+1−𝜔ₖ(𝐺)) time when using thedegeneracy-gapparameterization 𝛼+𝑘+1−𝜔ₖ(𝐺);here,𝛼 and Δ are the degeneracy and maximum degree of 𝐺 , respectively. Note that, most real graphs satisfy 𝜔𝑘 (𝐺) ≥ 𝑘 + 2 and 𝛼 ≪ 𝑛. Lastly, to improve the practical performance, we design a new degree- sequence-based reduction rule that can be efficiently applied, and theoretically demonstrate its effectiveness compared with the exist- ing reduction rules. Extensive empirical studies on three benchmark graph collections, containing 290 graphs in total, show that our algorithm is also practically efficient, by outperforming all existing algorithms by several orders of magnitude. We remark that our proving techniques for reducing the base from 𝛾ₖ to 𝛾ₖ₋₁ and our general principle of designing a new reduction rule may also be beneficial to other problems.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the massive social networks for providing personalized services, community search is widely studied to find the densely connected subgraph that can reflect the network properties for a given query. The existing community search methods adopt single community model to make structural constraints on communities, which can only describe single interaction mode. Since they fail to capture the semantics of the network with multiple interaction modes, they struggle to find the representative communities. To solve this issue, we design a novel community model called  ( 𝜏, 𝜌 ) camp to flexibly capture complex network semantics in any level of granularity. We propose the unified support maximized community search problem to find the communities with the densest network semantics, which is proven a NP-hard problem. By constructing a hierarchical index structure, we propose an approximate community search algorithm with approximation ratio of 2 and linear time complexity of the query size. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and two crawled datasets. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

    "title": "Scaling GPU-Accelerated Databases beyond GPU Memory Size",
    "abstract": "There has been considerable interest in leveraging GPUs’ computational power and high memory bandwidth for analytical database workloads. However, their limited memory capacity remains a fundamental limitation for databases whose sizes far exceed the GPU memory size. This challenge is exacerbated by the slow PCIe data transfer speed, that creates a bottleneck in overall system performance. In this work, we introduce a hybrid CPU-GPU query processing strategy that leverages the distinct strengths of CPU and GPU to alleviate the data transfer bottleneck. Our approach performs highly eﬃcient data ﬁltering on the CPU, which substantially reduces the volume of data transferred to the GPU via PCIe, and oﬄoads compute-intensive operators such as joins to the GPU for further processing. Our evaluation on the TPC-H benchmark at scale factors up to 1000 (1TB), using a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory, demonstrates that our approach can eﬀectively handle datasets signiﬁcantly larger than the GPU memory size. Moreover, it substantially outperforms a state-of-the-art CPU-only database system in both performance and cost-eﬀectiveness.",

    "abstract": "A space-filling curve (SFC) maps points in a multi-dimensional space to one-dimensional points by discretizing the multi-dimensional space into cells and imposing a linear order on the cells. This way, an SFC enables computing a one-dimensional layout for multidimensional data storage and retrieval. Choosing an appropriate SFC is crucial, as different SFCs have different effects on query performance. Currently, there are two primary strategies: 1) deterministic schemes, which are computationally efficient but often yield suboptimal query performance, and 2) dynamic schemes, which consider a broad range of candidate SFCs based on cost functions but incur significant computational overhead. Despite these strategies, existing methods cannot efficiently measure the effectiveness of SFCs under heavy query workloads and numerous SFC options.\nTo address this problem, we propose means of constant-time cost estimations that can enhance existing SFC selection algorithms, enabling them to learn more effective SFCs. Additionally, we propose an SFC learning method that leverages reinforcement learning and our cost estimations to choose an SFC pattern efficiently. Experimental studies offer evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed means of cost estimation and SFC learning.",

Unfortunately, real-world datasets frequently contain duplicates, whose presence biases sampling and impacts the quality of the produced subsets, hence the outcome of downstream tasks. While deduplication is therefore fundamental, performing it on the entire dataset to run sampling on its cleaned version might be prohibitively expensive in terms of time and resources. Thus, we recently introduced RadlER, a solution to perform  deduplicated sampling on-demand , i.e., to produce a clean sample of a dirty dataset incrementally, according to a target distribution of some subpopulations, by focusing the cleaning effort only on entities required to appear in the sample. \nIn this demonstration, we interactively show how RadlER can support practitioners in their data science pipelines, allowing them to save a relevant amount of time and resources.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in language models (LMs) open new opportunities for schema matching (SM). Recent approaches have shown their potential and key limitations: while small LMs (SLMs) require costly, difficult-to-obtain training data, large LMs (LLMs) demand significant computational resources and face context window constraints. We present  Magneto , a cost-effective and accurate solution for SM that combines the advantages of SLMs and LLMs to address their limitations. By structuring the SM pipeline in two phases, retrieval and reranking,  Magneto  can use computationally efficient SLMbased strategies to derive candidate matches which can then be reranked by LLMs, thus making it possible to reduce runtime while improving matching accuracy. We propose (1) a self-supervised approach to fine-tune SLMs which uses LLMs to generate syntactically diverse training data, and (2) prompting strategies that are effective for reranking. We also introduce a new benchmark, developed in collaboration with domain experts, which includes real biomedical datasets and presents new challenges for SM methods. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, using both our new and existing benchmarks, we show that  Magneto  is scalable and attains high accuracy for datasets from different domains.",

    "abstract": "Denial Constraints (DCs) are a ﬂexible formalism to express many types of data rules, making them a widely adopted tool for many applications. This ﬂexibility led to the development of numerous algorithms to automatically discover DCs directly from data. However, few studies have been conducted on the quality of the discovered DCs. We experimentally quantify the lack of quality in the results obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms, showing how the proportion of discovered DCs that are false is rarely below 95%. We hypothesize that the common source of these erroneous DCs stems from the adoption of the current DC validity deﬁnition. We use a statistical approach to explain the mechanism leading to these results, and propose a redeﬁnition of DC validity properties to avoid the acceptance of false DCs. We validate this redeﬁnition experimentally, showing that it exclusively accepts true constraints of the data, and is reliable enough to discover DCs missed by domain experts. Additionally, we provide curated sets of golden DCs for each dataset used in our study, those generated by domain experts and those discovered using our approach.",

    "abstract": "Today, the wide adoption of distributed service-oriented applications has rendered multi-database transactions increasingly important. They protect cross-service workflows that access multiple database systems from concurrency anomalies and failures. This paper presents Sonata, a new multi-database transaction system that provides high performance, global serializability, and seamless integration with existing applications and database systems. Sonata builds on the theory of commitment ordering to ensure global serializability and uses two-phase commit for atomicity and durability. Instead of treating database systems as black box storage, Sonata reuses existing database systems’ concurrency control yet refrains from exposing or modifying their internals. It performs additional non-blocking coordination only at prepare time via applicationlevel shim layers, allowing applications to incorporate Sonata without changing their existing queries or database systems. Evaluation using TPC-C shows that Sonata incurs 7.1% coordination overhead on average and outperforms prior work by up to 1114.3%.",

    "title": "Rebirth-Retire: A Concurrency Control Protocol Adaptable to Different Levels of Contention",
    "abstract": "The Wound-Retire concurrency control protocol was proposed to reduce contention for hotspots in in-memory databases. It enhances throughput under high-contention scenarios by allowing transactions to release their locks earlier (referred to as  Retire ), thereby reducing the wait times for other transactions. However, the proactive early release of locks introduces additional overhead, making it less efficient than other lock-based protocols in low-contention scenarios. Moreover, the wound strategy it adopts, while effective at preventing deadlocks, may lead to unnecessary transaction aborts. \nTo address these issues, this paper proposes the Rebirth-Retire concurrency control protocol as an enhancement to the WoundRetire protocol. In this protocol, a lock is retired by a younger transaction that requests it, which reduces unnecessary retire costs in low-contention scenarios. Additionally, rather than aborting younger transactions, older transactions are assigned larger timestamps (referred to as  Rebirth ), unless doing so would result in a deadlock. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the RebirthRetire protocol achieves better throughput and lower abort rate than the Wound-Retire protocol across varying levels of contention workloads.",

    "abstract": "Deletion Propagation (DP) refers to a family of database problems rooted in the classical view-update problem: how to propagate intended deletions in a view (query output) back to the source database while satisfying constraints and minimizing side e!ects. Although studied for over 40 years, DP variants, their complexities, and practical algorithms have been typically explored in isolation. \nThis work presents a uni\"ed and generalized framework for DP with several key bene\"ts: (1) It  uni!es and generalizes  all previously known DP variants, e!ectively subsuming them within a broader class of problems, including new, well-motivated variants. (2) It comes with a practical and general-purpose algorithm that is “ coarse-grained instance-optimal ”: it runs in PTIME for all known PTIME cases and can  automatically exploit structural regularities  in the data, i.e. it does not rely on hints about such regularities as part of the input. (3) It is  complete : our framework handles all known DP variants in all settings (including those involving self-joins, unions, and bag semantics), and allows us to provide new complexity results. (4) It is  easy to implement  and, in many cases, outperforms prior variant-speci\"c solutions, sometimes by orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Data lakehouse architectures unify the cost-efficiency of data lakes with the transactional guarantees of data warehouses. Yet, real-time ingestion often depends on external streaming systems such as Apache Kafka, along with bespoke connectors that read from Kafka and write into the lakehouse—leading to increased complexity and high operational costs. In particular, traditional leader-based data streaming platforms are designed for sub-100 ms low-latency workloads; however, when used for data-intensive ingestion in a cloud environment, cross availability-zone (AZ) disk-based replication significantly raises total infrastructure costs due to excessive network traffic and overprovisioned disk storage. This paper introduces Ursa, a leaderless, cloud-native, and Kafka-compatible streaming engine that writes data directly to open lakehouse tables on object storage. By eliminating leader-based replication, disk-based broker storage, and external connectors, Ursa markedly reduces infrastructure costs while preserving high throughput, exactly-once semantics, and near-real-time streaming capabilities. Experimental results show that Ursa matches the performance of traditional Kafka clusters at a fraction of the cost, offering up to a 10x reduction in infrastructure expenses.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of cardinality estimation for similarity search on high-dimensional data ( CE4HD ). We aim to perform  CE4HD  with high  data robustness  (i.e., robust to di ff erent datasets),  query robustness  (i.e., robust to large cardinality variance and scale) and e ffi ciency. We propose to leverage the cardinality es-and scale) and e ffi ciency. We propose to leverage the cardinality estimation of selected objects (called reference objects) in the database to achieve the above. Speci fi cally, we propose two techniques that adopt di ff erent strategies to select and leverage reference objects, as well as strategies to support e ffi cient computation in dynamic databases. Extensive experiments on datasets from diverse domains show that our methods achieve up to  ∼ 10x speed-up and up to ∼ 136x smaller mean Q-error compared to existing studies.",

    "title": "Auto-Prep: Holistic Prediction of Data Preparation Steps for Self-Service Business Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Business Intelligence (BI) plays a critical role in empowering modern enterprises to make informed data-driven decisions, and has grown into a billion-dollar business. Self-service BI tools like Power BI and Tableau have democratized the “dashboarding” phase of BI, by offering user-friendly, drag-and-drop interfaces that are tailored to non-technical enterprise users. However, despite these advances, we observe that the “data preparation” phase of BI continues to be a key pain point for BI users today. \nIn this work, we systematically study around 2K real BI projects harvested from public sources, focusing on the data-preparation phase of the BI workflows. We observe that users often have to program both (1) data transformation steps and (2) table joins steps, before their raw data can be ready for dashboarding and analysis. A careful study of the BI workflows reveals that transformation and join steps are often intertwined in the same BI project, such that considering both holistically is crucial to accurately predict these steps. Leveraging this observation, we develop an Auto-Prep system to holistically predict transformations and joins, using a principled graph-based algorithm inspired by Steiner-tree, with provable quality guarantees. Extensive evaluations using real BI projects suggest that Auto-Prep can correctly predict over 70% transformation and join steps, significantly more accurate than existing algorithms as well as language-models such as GPT-4.",

We argue that existing solutions, including recent lakehouse storage formats, have fundamental limitations and that there is a strong motivation for a specialized database engine, dedicated to serve as the catalog. We present the design and implementation of  TreeCat , a database engine that features a hierarchical data model with a path-based query language, a storage format optimized for efficient range queries and versioning, and a correlated scan operation that enables fast query execution. A key performance challenge is supporting concurrent read and write operations from many different clients while providing strict consistency guarantees. To this end, we present a novel MVOCC (multi-versioned optimistic concurrency control) protocol that guarantees serializable isolation. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing our concurrency control scheme with prior techniques, and evaluating our overall system against Hive Metastore, Delta Lake, and Iceberg.",

As currently implemented in production systems, sideways information passing enables only a  uni-directional  information flow, as opposed to instance-optimal algorithms, such as Yannakakis’. On the other hand, the latter require an additional pass over the input, which hinders adoption in production systems. \nIn this paper, we make a step towards enabling  single-pass bidirectional  information passing during query execution. We achieve this by statically analyzing between which tables the information flow is blocked and by leveraging precomputed join-induced fingerprint columns on FK-tables. On the JOB benchmark, Parachute improves DuckDB v1.2’s end-to-end execution time without and with semi-join filtering by 1.54x and 1.24x, respectively, when allowed to use 15% extra space.",

    "abstract": "Organizations across industries increasingly rely on sharing data to drive collaboration, innovation, and business performance. However, securely and eﬃciently sharing live data across diverse platforms and adhering to varying governance requirements remains a signiﬁcant challenge. Traditional approaches, such as FTP and proprietary in-data-warehouse solutions, often fail to meet the demands of interoperability, cost, scalability, and low overhead. This paper introduces Delta Sharing, an open protocol we developed in collaboration with industry partners, to overcome these limitations. Delta Sharing leverages open formats like Delta Lake and Apache Parquet alongside simple HTTP APIs to enable seamless, secure, and live data sharing across heterogeneous systems. Since its launch in 2021, Delta Sharing has been adopted by over 4000 enterprises and supported by hundreds of major software and data vendors. We discuss the key challenges in developing Delta Sharing and how our design addresses them. We also present, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst large-scale study of production data sharing workloads oﬀering insights into this emerging data platform capability.",

    "abstract": "Tail latency is crucial as it impacts user satisfaction and servicelevel objectives (SLOs). However, geo-distributed databases have long struggled with this issue due to wide-area network access, resulting in tail latencies of several or even exceeding ten seconds. In this paper, we highlight that further optimizing atomic commit protocols does not help but hit a tail latency wall. Instead, making concurrency control and access method selection geo-aware can mitigate this issue. To this end, we present Bonspiel, a new geo-distributed database equipped with geo-aware concurrency control and access method selection. In our experiments, Bonspiel successfully caps the tail latency of TPC-C at 1.8 seconds. Remarkably, it achieves this while maintaining full generality – it is fully SQL-compliant and strongly consistent, with both average latency and system throughput remaining at the top of the field.",

Their response time is bounded by intervention evaluation latency, which can be in the minute or hours for complex queries and large datasets.  FaDE is a compilation engine that uses provenance to evaluate hypothetical deletion and scaling interventions at low latency and high throughput.  FaDE  forgoes conventional provenance representations as symbolic expressions and leverages their underlying relational structure. This accelerates intervention evaluation on average by 1000 ×  against IVM and 10,000 ×  against prior provenance-based approaches. In addition,  FaDE  develops a suite of optimizations (e.g., compilation, parallelization, incremental evaluation, sparse representations) that collectively raise evaluation throughput to  > 1 million interventions per sec—a rate that can brute-force existing applications within 1 𝑠 .",

In a recently published work, we focused on claims that compare groups by an aggregate query, and explored the measurement of naturalness as well as the algorithmic challenge of handling the plenitude of possible views. ClaimIt realizes the framework as an interactive system that enables users to phrase their claims in a convenient user interface, extract supporting views, sort them by diﬀerent measures of naturalness, and control the weights of individual measures in a global ranking function.

We define a representa-tive time series in exploratory data mining. We define a representative time series, referred to as similarity-bounded representative time series, as one that represents other time series if their similarity meets a user-defined threshold. Building on this definition, we study the problem of finding the smallest set of such time series that can represent a specified proportion of all time series within the dataset. The representativeness of each similarity-bounded representative time series is controllable and determined by the specified level of similarity, and only the minimum number of such representatives needed to collectively represent the specified proportion of entire set are identified. Identifying representative time series over large-set are identified. Identifying representative time series over largescale data in an efficient and effective manner facilitates exploratory data analysis and summary generation, serving a wide range of data exploration applications across diverse domains. We first prove the NP-hardness of this problem and propose a range of approxima-NP-hardness of this problem and propose a range of approximation methods with theoretical guarantees, and we refer to them as non-learning-based methods. While effective, these methods often excel in either running time or memory efficiency, but not both concurrently. To overcome these limitations, we further propose a learning-based method that simultaneously optimizes both time and memory efficiency. This method leverages novel data prepara-and memory efficiency. This method leverages novel data preparation and training strategies, providing adaptability to user-specified representativeness requirements with low memory usage and com-representativeness requirements with low memory usage and computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments across four real-world datasets to demonstrate that our learning-based method is highly competitive with non-learning-based methods in terms of effectiveness (produces similar number of representative time series), while achieving significantly higher efficiency (up to 21 × speedups) and lower memory consumption (saving up to 101 × memory space).",

    "title": "LIMAO: A Framework for Lifelong Modular Learned Query Optimization",
    "abstract": "Query optimizers are crucial for the performance of database systems. Recently, many learned query optimizers (LQOs) have demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional optimizers. However, most of them operate under a limited assumption: a static query environment. This limitation prevents them from effectively handling complex, dynamic query environments in realworld scenarios. Extensive retraining can lead to the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem which reduces the LQO generalizability over time. In this paper, we address this limitation and introduce  LIMAO  ( Lifelong  Modular Learned Query Optimizer), a framework for lifelong learning of plan cost prediction that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LQOs.  LIMAO  leverages a modular lifelong learning technique, an attention-based neural network composition architecture, and an efficient training paradigm designed to retain prior knowledge while continuously adapting to new environments. We implement  LIMAO  in two LQOs, showing that our approach is agnostic to underlying engines. Experimental results show that  LIMAO  significantly enhances the performance of LQOs, achieving up to a 40% improvement in query execution time and reducing the variance of execution time by up to 60% under dynamic workloads. By leveraging a precise and self-consistent design,  LIMAO  effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting, ensuring stable and reliable plan quality over time. Compared to Postgres, LIMAO  achieves up to a 4× speedup on selected benchmarks, highlighting its practical advantages in real-world query optimization.",

    "title": "Dandelion: Smaller Clusters, Bigger Speeds—Distributed Transactions Redefined",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-memory, RDMA-enabled, highly-available, transactional Key-Value Store (KVS), dubbed Dandelion, that sig- nificantly improves performance in small deployments (e.g., 5-10 machines). Small deployments are motivated by the anticipated memory expansion (e.g., through CXL), which enables the deploy- ment of in-memory KVSes with few machines but lots of memory.\nA small deployment presents locality opportunities that have not been examined by related work. Specifically, it is more likely that at any given time, we must send multiple messages to the same recip- ient. We leverage this by transparently batching multiple requests in the same network packet. Similarly, there is a greater chance of having multiple requests that can be served by the local hashtable without going through the network. Sending all requests to the hashtable as a batch allows it to overlap their memory latencies through software prefetching. Finally, it is more likely that the node that requests a key is itself a backup of that key. We leverage this by allowing strongly-consistent local reads from backups.\nOur evaluation shows that these optimizations result in up to 6.5x throughput improvement over a state-of-the-art system, FaSST, in OLTP workloads in a 5-machine deployment. We characterize the impact and scalability of each of these optimizations with up to 10 machines – where Dandelion still offers as much as 3.5× higher throughput than FaSST.",

    "title": "Fair Transaction Processing For Multi-Tenant Databases",
    "abstract": "Multi-tenant transactional databases frequently observe contention on shared data, leading to a need for performance isolation. Databases typically provide performance isolation via a request rate limit or quota per tenant, but this approach can lead to system underutilization. Traditionally, fair sharing has been applied to achieve both performance isolation and high utilization in other domains. In this paper, we address the problem of fair sharing for transactions, which introduces new challenges because client requests do not acquire resources all at once. We propose DRFT, the first fair transaction scheduling algorithm that ensures both the share guarantee and strategy-proofness by accurately accounting for transactional resource usage. We evaluate DRFT on a range of standard benchmarks and real-world workloads, showing that it ensures fairness with less than a 5% throughput overhead compared to state-of-the-art scheduling policies.",

    "title": "Sphinteract: Resolving Ambiguities in NL2SQL Through User Interaction",
    "abstract": "Translating natural language questions into SQL queries (NL2SQL) is a challenging task of great practical importance. Prior work has extensively studied how to address NL2SQL using Large Language Models (LLMs) with solutions ranging from careful prompt engineering, to fine-tuning existing LLMs, or even training custom models. However, a remaining challenging problem in NL2SQL is the inherent ambiguity in the natural language questions asked by users. In this paper, we introduce Sphinteract, a framework designed to assist LLMs in generating high-quality SQL answers that accurately reflect the user intent. Our key insight to resolve ambiguity is to take into account minimal user feedback interactively. We introduce the  Summarize, Review, Ask  (SRA) paradigm, which guides LLMs in identifying ambiguities in NL2SQL tasks and generates targeted questions for the user to answer. We propose three different methods of how to process user feedback and generate SQL queries based on user input. Our experiments on the challenging KaggleDBQA and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that by means of asking clarification questions to the user, LLMs can efficiently incorporate the feedback, resulting in accuracy improvements of up to 42%.",

    "abstract": "Vector indexing enables semantic search over diverse corpora and has become an important interface to databases for both users and AI agents. Efficient vector search requires deep optimizations in database systems. This has motivated a new class of specialized vector databases that optimize for vector search quality and cost. Instead, we argue that a scalable, high-performance, and cost-efficient vector search system can be built inside a cloud-native operational database like Azure Cosmos DB while leveraging the benefits of a distributed database such as high availability, durability, and scale. We do this by deeply integrating DiskANN, a state-of-the-art vector indexing library, inside Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL. This system uses a single vector index per partition stored in existing index trees, and kept in sync with underlying data. It supports < 20ms query latency over an index spanning 10 million vectors, has stable recall over updates, and offers approximately 43 ×  and 12 ×  lower query cost compared to Pinecone and Zilliz serverless enterprise products. It also scales out to billions of vectors via automatic partitioning. This convergent design presents a point in favor of integrating vector indices into operational databases in the context of recent debates on specialized vector databases, and offers a template for vector indexing in other databases.",

    "title": "Approximation-First Timeseries Query At Scale",
    "abstract": "Timeseries monitoring systems such as Prometheus play a crucial role in gaining observability of the underlying system infrastructure. These systems collect timeseries metrics from various system components and perform monitoring queries over periodic windowbased aggregations (i.e., rule queries). However, despite wide adoption, the operational costs and query latency of rule queries remain high. In this paper, we identify major bottlenecks associated with repeated data scans and query computations concerning window overlaps in rule queries, and present PromSketch, an approximation-ﬁrst query framework as intermediate caches for monitoring systems. It enables low operational costs and query latency, by combining approximate window-based query frameworks and sketch-based precomputation. PromSketch is implemented as a standalone module that can be integrated into Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, covering 70% of Prometheus’ aggregation over time queries. Our evaluation shows that PromSketch achieves up to a two-orderof-magnitude reduction in query latency over Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, while lowering operational dollar costs of query processing by three orders of magnitude compared to Prometheus and by at least  4 ×  compared to VictoriaMetrics with at most 5% average errors across statistics.",

    "abstract": "Efficient route planning is crucial for modern navigation systems, yet traditional methods face challenges in scenarios with unknown or frequently changing traffic dynamics. This paper introduces a general labeling framework based on the 2-hop cover property, enabling robust, metric-independent preprocessing. Using this framework, we propose  Customizable Tree Labeling  (CTL), a tree-based method combining three key components: metric-independent preprocessing with tree hierarchies, metric customization for dynamic updates, and efficient query algorithms for fast route computation. To allow trade-offs between customization time, labeling size, and query performance, we further develop a parameterized customization technique by dynamically combining tree labels and shortcut graphs. Our key contributions include the introduction of a customizable labeling framework, a novel tree hierarchy for compact and scalable representation, and a hybrid query algorithm that integrates labels and shortcuts for fast and accurate route computation. We conduct extensive experiments on ten large-scale real-world road networks and a case study on the traffic assignment problem. Our algorithms achieve query response times significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive customization times and labeling size, making it well-suited for real-time and dynamic routing applications.",

    "abstract": "The number of triangles of a streaming graph is a crucial metric with various applications, such as network evolution analysis, community detection, and anomaly detection. A practical solution for triangle counting in streaming graphs is the sampling-based approximation. Although a lot of research efforts have been devoted to the fixed-sized memory based algorithms, they suffer from the accuracy and the efficiency issues. To tackle these issues, we first propose the generalized reservoir sampling (GRS), which stores less edges for reducing the computational cost and can still generate uniformly random edge sample in the streaming graph. Then, we propose the  GREAT  algorithm based on GRS for efficient and accurate triangle counting estimation. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose the  GREAT +   algorithm for considering the dynamic timestamp interval distribution in real-world streaming graphs so that triangles with short and long timestamp intervals will be sampled following the ground-truth distribution. Extensive evaluations on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of our algorithms. The relative error of our algorithm GREAT+ is significantly (an order of magnitude) better than the competitors.",

    "title": "Causal DAG Summarization",
    "abstract": "Causal inference aids researchers in discovering cause-and-effect relationships, leading to scientific insights. Accurate causal estimation requires identifying confounding variables to avoid false discoveries. Pearl’s causal model uses causal DAGs to identify confounding variables, but incorrect DAGs can lead to unreliable causal conclusions. However, for high dimensional data, the causal DAGs are often complex beyond human verifiability. Graph summarization is a logical next step, but current methods for general-purpose graph summarization are inadequate for causal DAG summarization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a causal graph summarization objective that balances graph simplification for better understanding while retaining essential causal information for reliable inference. We develop an efficient greedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for inference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing robustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we compared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that ensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.",

Graph reordering  is an optimization strategy aiming to improve the graph data layout. It has shown to be effective to speed up graph analytics workloads, but its effect on the performance of GNN training has not been investigated yet. The generalization of reordering to GNN performance is nontrivial, as multiple aspects must be considered: GNN hyper-parameters such as the number of layers, the number of hidden dimensions, and the feature size used in the GNN model, neural network operations, large intermediate vertex states, and GPU acceleration. \nIn our work, we close this gap by performing an empirical evalua-In our work, we close this gap by performing an empirical evaluation of 12 reordering strategies in two state-of-the-art GNN systems, PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library.

    "abstract": "The join order (JO) optimization problem is a key challenge in query optimization. Classical approaches can compute the optimal solution for smaller queries. For larger queries, some heuristic methods trade off plan quality to reduce the exponential search space. Recently, quantum-based methods have been proposed to leverage quantum mechanisms to accelerate exploration; however, encoding problem-specific constraints as penalty terms introduces extra overhead. Moreover, quantum-inspired methods on classical hardware do not harness the true advantages of quantum computation. Furthermore, these methods remain at the simulation stage. \nIn this demonstration, we present the first Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer ( Q 2 O ) that integrates a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve the JO problem in a real database setup. This demonstration allows conference attendees to interact directly with Q 2 O  by executing queries and viewing detailed execution results (Scenario 1). Users can easily compare plan quality between  Q 2 O and PostgreSQL (Scenario 2). Additionally, they can experiment with quantum parameters to observe their impact (Scenario 3). Experimental results show that the query plan generated by our approach achieves up to a 13x speedup in query execution. The video corresponding to this demonstration is available at   this link .",

    "abstract": "Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and serverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high performance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory environments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets  much larger  than main memory, and natural  skew in key access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have been widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from suboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a high-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable success in both inmemory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked with serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high indexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of non-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets. \nIn this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER designed to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry applications. F2 adopts a two-tier recordoriented design to handle larger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free mechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To realize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows that F2 achieves 2-11 . 9 ×  better throughput compared to existing KV stores, effectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as part of the FASTER project.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-Temporal Prediction (STP) is crucial for various smart city applications, such as traffic management and resource allocation. However, training samples can be scarce in data-constrained scenarios, which often degrades the predictive capability of existing deep STP models. Although recent STP foundation models excel in few-shot and zero-shot learning through extensive pre-training on large-scale, multi-domain spatio-temporal data, they often rely on large parameter scale to achieve enhanced performance, resulting in high computational demands that hinder practical deployment. In response, we develop CompactST, an efficient, compact, and versatile pre-trained model for STP in data-scarce settings. Recognizing the complexities posed by large-scale, heterogeneous pre-training datasets, CompactST integrates three specialized components: (1) a mixture-of-normalizers module to address domain and spatial heterogeneity, (2) a multi-scale spatio-temporal mixer that captures diverse patterns from datasets with varying spatio-temporal resolutions, and (3) an adaptive dataset-oriented tuning module that transfers the handling of dataset-specific parameters from pre-training to fine-tuning stage. These tailored designs enable CompactST to maximize generalizability across diverse datasets while maintaining a compact model size ( i.e. , only 300K parameters). To validate its effectiveness, we pre-train CompactST on a substantial corpus of public spatio-temporal datasets spanning over 10 domains and encompassing 300 million data points. Extensive experimental results on ten real-world datasets demonstrate CompactST’s significantly improved prediction accuracy and efficiency in data-scarce scenarios.",

    "title": "Doctopus: Budget-aware Structural Table Extraction from Unstructured Documents",
    "abstract": "To fulfill the potential great value of unstructured documents, it is critical to extract structural data (e.g., attributes) from them, which can benefit various applications such as analytical SQL queries and decision-making. Multiple strategies, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), can be employed for this task. However, these methods often struggle to achieve high-quality results, particularly when dealing with attribute extraction that requires intricate reasoning or semantic comprehension. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have proven to be effective in extracting attributes but incur substantial costs caused by token consumption, making them impractical for large-scale document set. \nTo best trade off quality and cost, we present  Doctopus , a system designed for accurate attribute extraction from unstructured documents with a user-specified cost constraint. Overall,  Doctopus combines LLMs with non-LLM strategies to achieve a good tradeoff. First, the system employs an index-based approach to efficiently identify and process only relevant text chunks, thereby reducing the LLM cost. Afterwards, it further estimates the quality of multiple strategies for each attribute. Finally, based on the cost and estimated quality,  Doctopus  dynamically selects the optimal strategies through budget-aware optimization. We have built a comprehensive benchmark including 4 document sets with various characteristics and manually labeled ground truth using 1000 human hours. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines,  Doctopus  can improve the quality by 11% given the same cost constraint.",

    "title": "Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Alignment for Graph Edit Distance Computation and Beyond",
    "abstract": "Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely recognized metric for measuring graph similarity, yet its NP-complete nature poses challenges for fast and accurate computation. This paper introduces FGWAlign, an Optimal Transport (OT)-based approach for graph alignment and GED computation. We take the first step to theoretically demonstrate and that computing GED can be transformed into optimizing a particular OT variant—the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Tailored to the GED problem structure, we further implement three key enhancements to the standard FGW solver: (1) a random exploration scheme to better locate the global optimum, (2) a diverse projection strategy for post-processing the transportation plan to escape local optima, and (3) a novel extension to accommodate multi-relational graphs with edge labels. With  O(| 𝑽 || 𝑬 |)  time complexity and  O(| 𝑽 | 2 )  space complexity, where  | 𝑽 |  and  | 𝑬 |  are the maximum number of nodes and edges between the two compared graphs, FGWAlign achieves a superior balance of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Empirical results show that, compared with 12 representative GED computation methods across different categories on 4 real-world graph datasets, FGWAlign reduces computation errors by over 80% and achieves 15-60 ×  speedup. It also demonstrates promising resutls on downstream applications including labeled graph alignment and graph-level anomaly detection, highlighting its versatility. FGWAlign opens up promising avenues for future applications in graph data management.",

    "abstract": "Many GaussDB customers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), require high transaction throughput with occasional analytical queries. HTAP systems that deploy both OLTP and OLAP engines on a single server to manage hybrid workloads have become increasingly popular among customers for achieving high cost-efficiency and data freshness. However, co-locating these systems can lead to resource contention, particularly for memory, potentially degrading overall system performance and causing Service-Level Agreements (SLA) violations. To address this issue, we propose  𝑇 2   ( T wisted  T win), an adaptive memory management approach that dynamically allocates memory between OLTP and OLAP components. This approach ensures OLTP meets SLA while optimizing the efficiency of OLAP query processing. However, this is non-trivial, as memory allocation triggers a cascade of effects, including in-memory column selection and data synchronization, both critical in HTAP systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a Bayesian optimization framework tailored for fluctuating workloads that adjusts memory allocation responsively. Experiments conducted on the real-world HTAP system, GaussDB-HTAP, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of  𝑇 2 .",

    "abstract": "Writing SPARQL queries is often an iterative process, where users refine queries until they meet their information needs. However, long-running query executions can lead to inefficient workflows, as users must wait idly for results Ð potentially without success due to strict timeouts imposed by public endpoints. In this demo, we present the  Smart SPARQL Advisor  (SSA), a system that integrates Query Performance Prediction (QPP) to proactively mitigate these issues. By predicting query runtimes prior to execution, SSA alerts users to potentially slow or timeout-prone queries and, when necessary, employs a large language model (LLM) guided by latent representations from the QPP model to suggest alternative query formulations. We demonstrate that SSA enables users to identify performant queries and understand performance bottlenecks, thereby reducing idle time and avoiding unproductive query executions. Through this approach, SSA fosters more responsive and resource-efficient interactions with triplestores, enhancing both user experience and triplestore utilization.",

Key contributions include a scalable data generator that synthesizes datasets with financial-specific features, a parameter generator that leverages bucketed data statistics for runtime consistency across queries, and a scalable benchmark driver that biases query execution by time windows.

However, with the rapid advancement of cloud computing and AIdriven models for database optimization, traditional virtual index approaches face significant challenges. Cloud-native environments often prohibit direct conducting query optimization process on production databases due to stability requirements and data privacy concerns. Moreover, while AI models show promising progress, their integration with database systems poses challenges in system complexity, inference acceleration, and model hot updates. In this paper, we present VIDEX, a three-layer disaggregated architecture that decouples database instances, the virtual index optimizer, and algorithm services, providing standardized interfaces for AI model integration. Users can configure VIDEX by either collecting production statistics or loading from a prepared file, enabling highaccuracy what-if analysis using virtual indexes that yield query plans identical to production instances. Additionally, users can freely integrate new AI-driven algorithms into VIDEX.

This has led to the rapid development of a central aspect of “Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations\" (AIOps), focusing on detecting anomalies in vast amounts of multivariate time series data generated by service entities. In this paper, we begin by introducing a unifying framework for benchmarking unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, and highlight the problem of shifts in normal behaviors that can occur in practical AIOps scenarios. To tackle anomaly detection under domain shift, we then cast the problem in the framework of domain generalization and propose a novel approach, Domain-Invariant VAE for Anomaly Detection (DIVAD), to learn domain-invariant representations for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our evaluation results using the Exathlon benchmark show that the two main DIVAD variants significantly outperform the best unsupervised AD method in maximum performance, with 20% and 15% improvements in maximum peak F1-scores, respectively. Evaluation using the Application Server Dataset further demonstrates the broader applicability of our domain generalization methods.",

    "abstract": "LSM-tree-based data stores are widely adopted in industries for their excellent performance. As data scale increases, disk-based join operations become indispensable yet costly for the database, making the selection of suitable join methods crucial for system optimization. Current LSM-based stores generally adhere to conventional relational database practices and support only a limited number of join methods. However, the LSM-tree delivers distinct read and write eﬃciency compared to the relational databases, which could accordingly impact the performance of various join methods. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider the selection of join methods in this context to fully explore the potential of various join algorithms and index designs. In this work, we present a systematic study and an exhaustive benchmark for joins over LSM-trees. We deﬁne a conﬁguration space for join methods, encompassing various join algorithms, secondary index types, and consistency strategies. We also summarize a theoretical analysis to evaluate the overhead of each join method for an in-depth understanding. Furthermore, we implement all join methods in the conﬁguration space on a uniﬁed platform and compare their performance through extensive experiments. Our theoretical and experimental results yield several insights and takeaways tailored to joins in LSM-based stores that aid developers in choosing proper join methods based on their working conditions.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in multivariate time series forecasting by addressing the challenge of modeling inter-series dependencies often overlooked by traditional temporal approaches. However, real-world temporal dependencies (inter- and intra-dependencies) are inherently intertwined, making it difficult to treat them as separate processes. Recent pure graph paradigms attempt to capture these dependencies holistically by transforming time series into fully connected graphs. While effective, these methods suffer from prohibitive computational complexity  O(( 𝑁𝑇 ) 2 ) , limiting their scalability for large-scale data and long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose UFGTime, a novel framework that leverages spectral signals to construct a \"spectral-variate graph,\" embedding multivariate temporal dependencies in a compact spectral representation and modeling inter- and intra-signal connections through frequency similarities. Empowered by our proposed graph framelet message-passing function, UFGTime efficiently aggregates global information, avoids over-smoothing, and achieves near-linear complexity  O( 𝑘𝑁𝑇 ) . Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that UFGTime consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable, accurate, and resource-efficient pure graph solution for multivariate time series forecasting.",

    "abstract": "As applications and data evolve over time, the database schema  must be adjusted to accommodate their needs. Schema changes  in  relational  databases  have  traditionally  required  synchronization with concurrent read and write access, causing  signiﬁcant interruptions to user applications. Although, most  commercial databases have optimized common schema changes  to reduce their runtime, they have not fundamentally addressed  the requirement for synchronization which can lead to data  being inaccessible for minutes or even hours in the presence of  long running queries. MD-MVCC is a new technology in Azure  SQL Database that enables multi-version concurrency control for  schema changes. is allows schema changes to occur without  any synchronization with concurrent queries which can operate  on the earlier version of the schema until ongoing operations are  commied, following Snapshot Isolation semantics. Schema  deployments can now occur with minimal impact, increasing  data availability but also ﬂexibility for application developers.  is required a comprehensive redesign of the schema  management and metadata components of the RDBMS that are  now multi-versioned across all layers, from query execution and  in-memory caches to the system tables where metadata is  persisted. is paper presents the overall design of MD-MVCC  and demonstrates how it fundamentally improves data  availability during schema changes without incurring any  performance overheads.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Business Intelligence (BI), existing solutions face critical challenges in industrial deployments: functionality deficiencies from legacy systems failing to meet evolving LLM-era user demands, interaction limitations from single-round SQL generation paradigms inadequate for multi-round clarification, and cost for domain adaptation arising from cross-domain methods migration. \nWe present SiriusBI, a practical LLM-powered BI system addressing the challenges of industrial deployments through three key innovations: (a) An end-to-end architecture integrating multi-module coordination to overcome functionality gaps in legacy systems; (b) A multi-round dialogue with querying mechanism, consisting of semantic completion, knowledge-guided clarification, and proactive querying processes, to resolve interaction constraints in SQL generation; (c) A data-conditioned SQL generation method selection strategy that supports both an efficient one-step Fine-Tuning approach and a two-step method leveraging Semantic Intermediate Representation for low-cost cross-domain applications. Experiments on both real-world datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SiriusBI. User studies further confirm that SiriusBI enhances both productivity and user experience. \nAs an independent service on Tencent’s data platform, SiriusBI is deployed across finance, advertising, and cloud sectors, serving dozens of enterprise clients. It achieves over 93% accuracy in SQL generation and reduces data analysts’ query time from minutes to seconds in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Balanced  𝑘 -means ensures representative centroids by forming equal-sized clusters, but struggles with slow clustering of massive distributed attributes and data-sharing restrictions. A common approach is adapting it to a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, preventing raw data exposure by only intermediate result exchange and accelerating clustering via parallelism, yet it remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a   t ime-efficient, f e derated, and   b alanced  𝑘 - means  algorithm, called  Teb-means , to bridge the gap. We first formulate the balanced  𝑘 -means problem as a trace maximization problem (TMP) and propose an efficient coordinatewise optimization (CO) scheme to solve it. We then integrate TMP and CO into the VFL framework by demonstrating that TMP can be decomposed into multiple subproblems based on each party’s data, which can be solved using CO while exchanging only intermediate results. Notably, we build a trade-off between utility and communication efficiency by designing a greedy block-based strategy for CO (GBCO). Our theoretical analysis shows that  Teb-means achieves linear time complexity on each client, and our communication round is constant in the mild condition. Experiments show that  Teb-means  is on average 12.18 ×  faster than other balanced clustering algorithms that can be federated, while achieving better balance without disrupting the cluster structure.",

    "abstract": "Graph data analysis, particularly local triangle counting, plays a pivotal role in deciphering complex relationships within graph data. This method is invaluable across diverse fields such as social networks, transportation, and cybersecurity. However, this process often involves handling sensitive information, necessitating that the relationship between any two nodes is considered private. Differential privacy (DP) is a formal model to address privacy concerns and can be categorized into two types: the central DP (CDP) model, which achieves better result accuracy, and the local DP (LDP) model, which does not assume a trusted server. To bridge the gap between the two models, we propose  Sectric , a   se rver-aided   c rypto-assisted local   tri angle   c ounting protocol, in this paper. It can achieve the same result accuracy with the same privacy budget as the CDP model without assuming a trusted server.  Sectric  also explores a new approach in crypto-assisted graph data analysis algorithms that represents a node’s neighbors using a set instead of an adjacency vector, and successfully achieves higher efficiency compared to other crypto-assisted solutions. We also conduct theoretical and empirical evaluations to demonstrate that  Sectric  achieves the design principles.",

    "title": "How SMPC Query Execution can be sped up through Efficient and Flexible Intermediate Result Size Trimming",
    "abstract": "There is growing interest in Secure Collaborative Analytics, but fully oblivious query execution in Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) settings is prohibitively expensive. Recent related works proposed different approaches to trimming the size of intermediate results between oblivious query operators, resulting in significant speedups at the cost of some controlled information leakage. In Reflex, we generalize these ideas into a flexible and efficient trimming method for the output of the oblivious operators, that we call Resizer. Resizers can be seamlessly integrated between MPCbased query operators. This allows for precisely controlling the security/performance trade-off on a per-operator and per-query basis. Our method has the potential to accelerate the performance of current oblivious query execution by up to 200 times compared to fully oblivious query execution, and by approximately 7 times compared to existing approaches with the same security guarantees. Our work lays down the foundation for a future MPC query planner that can pick different performance and security targets when composing physical plans. \nThis demonstration showcases the benefits of Reflex. More precisely, it focuses on the integration of our proposed resizers into the oblivious query plan, significantly enhancing performance. Conference attendees will have the opportunity to observe the efficient trimming of intermediate results and, additionally, they will be able to configure the oblivious execution settings, ranging from fully oblivious to fully revealed. This hands-on experience will highlight the benefits of our proposal in various obliviousness scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe veDB-HTAP, a highly integrated, efficient, and adaptive HTAP system recently built in ByteDance. veDB-HTAP adopts a highly integrated system architecture by leveraging the Secondary Engine mechanism provided by MySQL and provides a seamless query processing experience across OLTP and OLAP engines. In addition, we introduce a cost-based and machine-learning-based smart query router that significantly outperforms the rule-based query router used in ByteHTAP, a precursor of veDB-HTAP. A key design principle of veDB-HTAP is the collaboration and adaptability of major system components, including query planning, query execution, and unified storage. Our adaptive query execution can be classified into two categories: 1) adaptive execution that dynamically collects and utilizes runtime statistics for better query performance; 2) utilizing runtime resource information to achieve a high quality of service even under heavy workloads. The experiments show that veDB-HTAP can achieve more than 3 ×  speedup for TPC-H while consuming only one-third of the resources compared to ByteHTAP.",

    "abstract": "Capturing the characteristics of real-world analytical workloads is challenging yet critical for advancing industry practices and academic research. Historically, obtaining accurate query and data characteristics has been difficult, largely because detailed workload information has often been confined to on-premises database systems. With the rise of cloud-native databases like Snowflake, it has become possible to analyze production query workloads at scale and in greater detail. Leveraging this capability, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of analytics workloads across diverse customers and industries. In particular, we investigate the query characteristics of 667 million queries issued by the most popular BI tools against Snowflake over a two-week period. Based on this dataset, this paper makes two primary contributions: first, we conduct a detailed examination of query properties, with particular attention to filters, joins, aggregations, and other previously underexplored aspects. Second, we uncover unique and practically relevant query patterns that are typically absent from standard database benchmarks.",

    "title": "Migration-Free Elastic Storage of Time Series in Apache IoTDB",
    "abstract": "In distributed time series databases (TSDBs), time series data are typically partitioned by both series and time. These partitions are then allocated to shards, whose replicas determine the storage location, with the leader managing the write load. In Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, clusters expand as the number of sensors continues to grow. A common approach to re-balancing storage is migrating existing partitions, yet it incurs additional overhead. Fortunately, Time to Live (TTL) is often implemented in time series databases to automatically unload expired data. As a result, dynamically expanding shards rather than migrating existing partitions can also restore storage balance. In addition, the cluster’s fault tolerance depends on replica placement schemes, and an expanding cluster complicates this issue. Finally, the intensive write load in IoT scenarios requires balanced leader selection, which becomes difficult due to fault-tolerant placement schemes. To address these IoT challenges, this paper presents the migration-free data partitioning and allocation strategies, a storage-balanced replica placement algorithm with proven fault tolerance, and a write-balanced leader selection algorithm. Our proposals have been deployed in Apache IoTDB since version 1.3. Extensive evaluation of the system demonstrates its superiority in availability and performance.",

    "abstract": "Federated graph learning (FGL) is a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing.

    "abstract": "Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of graph analytics, crit ically suﬀers from redundant computations during the search process. Existing methods primarily target identical computations redundant operations that are localized to individual query vertices but fail to address similar redundancies that recur across multiple query vertices. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, called FiPE, that accelerates subgraph matching through   Fi ne-grained and   P owerful E quivalences. FiPE redeﬁnes redundancy elimination by shifting the optimization granularity from isolated vertices to vertex pairs and multiple vertex patterns. It introduces  vertex-pair equivalence  to cluster candidate pairs with isomorphic neighbor structures, even if their individual vertices diﬀer, enabling pruning of similar computations between these vertex pairs. FiPE proposes  group equivalence  to defer equivalence checks to later search depths, capturing potential redundancies incrementally. To fully exploit the advantages of the equivalence, we introduce two optimization techniques: a matching order generation method to reduce the overall search space and an efficient conﬂict resolution mechanism to avoid two query vertices being mapped to the same data vertex. Experiments on real-world graphs highlight the superiority of FiPE. FiPE achieves a speedup of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude on various graphs under the EPS (embeddings per second) metric.",

    "title": "Discovering Approximate Inclusion Dependencies",
    "abstract": "Inclusion dependencies ( INDs ) are widely used in data management tasks. The discovery techniques of  INDs  have thus received a lot of attention, for discovering  INDs  valid in data. However, real-world data quality issues may lead to partial violations of  INDs . This paper makes the first effort to provide a comprehensive study on the discovery of approximate  INDs  ( AINDs ), aiming to identify  INDs with error rates below a given threshold. This paper introduces a new definition of  AIND  based on deletion semantics, in addition to the existing definition based on insertion semantics. A discovery method is developed that can be configured to identify  AINDs based on either of these semantics. The method combines partitioning techniques to handle tables that cannot all fit into memory simultaneously, with novel approaches to quantify  AIND  violations based on partitioned tables. To improve efficiency, the method employs a novel three-layer filtering structure and techniques that can potentially prune invalid candidate  AINDs  and identify valid AINDs  without necessarily processing all tuples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation and verify the following: the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods for AIND  discovery based on insertion semantics, the  AIND  discoveries with insertion and deletion semantics can provide complementary results, and our discovery method can effectively deal with dirty dataset containing various types of errors.",

    "title": "SCompression: Enhancing Database Knob Tuning Efficiency Through Slice-Based OLTP Workload Compression",
    "abstract": "Workload execution can account for 90% of the total database knob tuning time, which is often the bottleneck for efficient knob tuning in practice. Reducing the tuning time by using a compressed workload is a natural solution. However, many existing workload compression methods are designed for OLAP workloads, which reduce the number of queries needed for analysis tasks by sampling a small subset of queries. These methods are less effective for OLTP workloads in knob-tuning tasks, as they often disregard essential contextual details, including query sequence and concurrency. As a result, configurations that perform well on the compressed OLTP workload may not deliver similar competitive performance on the original workload. To address these challenges, we first define the objective of OLTP workload compression for knob tuning. We then propose a slice-based compression method,  SCompression , which compresses workloads by slicing based on time intervals while preserving concurrency.  SCompression  achieves the objective by focusing on generating a compressed workload that (1) executes faster than the original workload and (2) produces performance variations similar to the source workload under different configurations. SCompression  works in three steps: (1) dividing the workload into segments to capture regular performance fluctuations, (2) slicing each segment to preserve concurrency and transaction context, and (3) sampling slices under execution time constraints using a clusterbased approach to ensure representativeness. Finally,  SCompression replays the compressed workload to produce the performance that mirrors the source workload. Extensive experiments on real-world and benchmark OLTP workloads show that  SCompression  is a costeffective solution for knob tuning, accelerating tuning by up to 40 × with only a 5% performance reduction.",

    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization. Traditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However, organizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data access. Fortunately,  query-driven  cardinality estimation can learn CardEst models using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often require access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume  perfect  training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join graphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join templates are incomplete and imbalanced. \nWe present GRASP, a  data-agnostic  cardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world constraints. GRASP’s compositional design  generalizes to unseen join templates and is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new pertable CardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and a novel  learned count sketch  model that captures join correlations across base relations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP consistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads, both in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches built over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark — despite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible join templates.",

Motivated by the requirements of scaling diverse data science applications, we present the design and implementation of Xorbits, a native scalable data science engine built on our decentralized actor model, Xoscar. Our actor model can eliminate dependency on a global scheduler and enable fast actor task scheduling. We also provide reference-based distributed storage with unified access across heterogeneous memory resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Xorbits achieves up to 3.22 ×  speedup on 3 machine learning pipelines and 22 data analysis workloads compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Second, we aim to evaluate  predicateagnostic  filtered vector search queries, where the k nearest neighbors (kNNs) of a query vector  𝑣 𝑄 are searched across an arbitrary subset  𝑆 of vectors that is specified by an ad-hoc selection sub-query 𝑄 𝑆 . We adopt a prefiltering-based approach that evaluates  𝑄 𝑆 first and passes the full information about  𝑆 to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering-based search algorithm that is robust under different selectivities as well as correlations of  𝑆 with  𝑣 𝑄 . We propose an adaptive algorithm that utilizes local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW graph to pick a suitable heuristic at each iteration of the kNN search algorithm. We demonstrate NaviX’s robustness and efficiency through extensive experiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based baselines.",

    "title": "mLoRA: Fine-Tuning LoRA Adapters via Highly-Efficient Pipeline Parallelism in Multiple GPUs",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse domains, particularly in the emerging  pretrain-then-finetune  paradigm. LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is commonly used to adapt a base LLM to multiple downstream tasks. Further, LLM platforms enable developers to fine-tune multiple models and develop various domain-specific applications simultaneously. However, existing model parallelism schemes suffer from high communication overhead and inefficient GPU utilization. \nIn this paper, we present mLoRA, a parallelism-efficient finetuning system designed for training multiple LoRA across GPUs and machines. mLoRA introduces a novel LoRA-aware pipeline parallelism scheme that efficiently pipelines LoRA adapters and their distinct fine-tuning stages across GPUs and machines, along with a new LoRA-efficient operator to enhance GPU utilization. Our extensive evaluation shows that mLoRA can significantly reduce average fine-tuning task completion time, e.g., by 30%, compared to state-of-the-art methods like FSDP. More importantly, mLoRA enables simultaneous fine-tuning of larger models, e.g., two Llama2-13B models on four NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GPUs, which is not feasible for FSDP due to high memory requirements. Hence, mLoRA not only increases fine-tuning efficiency but also makes it more accessible on cost-effective GPUs.",

    "abstract": "The widespread existence of time series data in information systems poses significant challenges to data cleaning due to its quality issues, particularly the complex interdependencies among attributes and the persistence of errors. Existing semantic constraints, such as conditional regression rules and speed constraints, though helpful, remain insufficient for this task. This paper introduces two novel online cleaning methods: MTSClean and MTSClean-soft, designed to improve cleaning efficiency and robustness. By combining row and column constraints, we significantly accelerate the cleaning process, reducing the time complexity of the exact solution MTSClean from 𝑂(︁(𝑁𝑀)3.5|Σ|)︁ to 𝑂(︁𝑁𝑀3.5|Σ|)︁.

    "title": "IcedTea: Efficient and Responsive Time-Travel Debugging in Dataflow Systems",
    "abstract": "Dataﬂow systems have an increasing need to support a wide range of tasks in data-centric applications using latest techniques such as machine learning. These tasks often involve custom functions with complex internal states. Consequently, users need enhanced debugging support to understand runtime behaviors and investigate internal states of dataﬂows. Traditional forward debuggers allow users to follow the chronological order of operations in an execution. Therefore, a user cannot easily identify a past runtime behavior  after an unexpected result is produced. In this paper, we present a novel time-travel debugging paradigm called  IcedTea , which supports reverse debugging. In particular, in a dataﬂow’s execution, which is inherently distributed across multiple operators, the user can periodically interact with the job and retrieve the global states of the operators. After the execution, the system allows the user to roll back the dataﬂow state to any past interactions. The user can use step instructions to repeat the past execution to understand how data was processed in the original execution. We give a full speciﬁcation of this powerful paradigm, study how to reduce its runtime overhead and develop techniques to support debugging instructions responsively. Our experiments on real-world datasets and workﬂows show that  IcedTea  can support responsive time-and workﬂows show that  IcedTea  can support responsive timetravel debugging with low time and space overhead.",

    "abstract": "Data centers produce a significant and increasing amount of CO 2 emissions. In the past, these have been predominantly due to energy generation for powering data centers. With the transition to energy sources with lower carbon production, the embodied carbon (i.e., CO 2  and other greenhouse gas emissions during production, transport, and end-of-life) plays an increasing role when planning server lifecycles. While replacing an old server with newer hardware will typically reduce the power consumption of individual tasks, due to better efficiency of modern CPUs, offsetting the embodied carbon of new hardware can take months to tens of years, depending on the grid carbon intensity. In this demo, we invite attendees to interactively analyze the ecological lifecycles of modern database servers for different workloads and grid carbon intensities. Attendees can compare servers with different CPU architectures and estimate ecological deployment cycles for database servers.",

    "abstract": "SSDs are hardware and software systems whose design involves complex and undocumented trade-oﬀs between cost, energy consumption and performance. This complexity is hidden behind standard interfaces and a few headline speciﬁcations, such as capacity, sequential, and random performance. As a result, database system designers often assume that SSDs are interchangeable commodities and regularly use a single SSD model to evaluate database performance. Does it matter which SSD model is provisioned for a database system? If yes, how to choose the right one? These are the questions we address in this paper. We study the performance characteristics of commercial data center SSDs, highlighting the limitations of current standard metrics in capturing their true behavior. We conduct experiments on nine SSDs from major vendors, revealing signiﬁcant diﬀerences in performance despite similar headline speciﬁcations. We show that the choice of SSD matters for database system performance. We propose a new benchmark,  SSD-iq , which introduces four additional metrics to better characterize SSD performance, particularly for write-intensive workloads. Incidentally, our work should encourage vendors to optimize SSD controllers using more comprehensive and transparent performance criteria.",

    "abstract": "Nearest neighbor search (NNS) is fundamental for high-dimensional space retrieval and impacts various fields, such as pattern recognition, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and vector database management. Among existing NNS methods, graph-based methods often excel in query accuracy and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges, including high construction costs and difficulties with dynamic data updates. Recent efforts have focused on combining graph methods with hashing, quantization, and tree-based approaches to address these issues, but problems with large index sizes and update performance remain unresolved. In response, this paper proposes  GTI , a novel, lightweight, and dynamic graph-based tree index for high-dimensional NNS.  GTI  constructs a tree index built across the entire dataset and employs a lightweight graph index at the level 1 of the tree to significantly reduce graph construction costs. It also features effective data insertion and deletion algorithms that enable logarithmic realtime updates. Additionally, we have developed an effective NNS algorithm for  GTI , which not only achieves approximate search performance on par with SOTA graph-based methods but also supports exact NNS. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that  GTI  achieves an approximately 10 ×  improvement in update efficiency compared to SOTA tree-based methods, while achieving search effectiveness comparable to SOTA approximate NNS methods. These results underscore the potential of  GTI  for effective application in dynamic and evolving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Modern data stores increasingly rely on metadata to enable diverse activities such as data cataloging and search. However, metadata curation remains a labor-intensive task, and the broader challenge of metadata maintenanceÐensuring its consistency and usefulnessÐhas been largely overlooked. In this work, we tackle the problem of resolving relationships among metadata concepts from disparate sources. Inferring these relationships are critical for creating clean and consistent metadata repositories, and a central challenge for metadata integration. \nWe propose  OpenForge , a two-stage prior-posterior framework for metadata integration. In the first stage,  OpenForge  exploits multiple methods including fine-tuned large language models to obtain prior beliefs about concept relationships. In the second stage, OpenForge  refines these predictions using the Markov Random Field, a probabilistic graphical model. We formalize metadata integration as an optimization problem, where the objective is to identify the relationship assignments that maximize the joint probability of assignments. The MRF formulation allows  OpenForge  to capture prior beliefs while encoding critical relationship properties, such as transitivity, in probabilistic inference. Experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of  OpenForge . In a use case of matching two metadata vocabularies,  OpenForge outperforms GPT-4, the second-best method, by 25 F1 points.",

    "abstract": "Data scientists today often need to analyze data from various places. This makes it necessary for corresponding engines to support query federation (i.e., the ability to perform SQL queries over data hosted in different sources). Although many systems come with federation capabilities, their implementations are tightly coupled with the core engine design. This not only increases complexity and reduces portability across engines, but also often leads to performance issues by missing optimization opportunities. This paper proposes Accio, a new “bolt-on” approach to query federation. Accio is a middleware library that decouples query federation from the target system. It enables two key optimizations—join pushdown and query partitioning—via a declarative interface that can be easily leveraged by different engines. Our experience of adapting five popular data science query engines shows that Accio can outperform existing approaches by orders of magnitude in various scenarios without the need for any intrusive changes or extra maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured free text documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have significantly simplified the prototyping of such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing them efficiently remains challenging and demands significant effort. Developers must often orchestrate heterogeneous systems, manage data movement, and handle low-level concerns such as LLM context management. \nTo address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that integrates LLM capabilities and enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) within SQL. FlockMTL provides LLM-powered scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions over tuples. It further provides data fusion functions to support hybrid search. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) seamless optimizations such as batching and meta-prompting; and (ii) resource independence through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE.",

    "abstract": "Vector databases are widely used as a fundamental tool for addressing the weaknesses of large language model (LLM) applications, speciﬁcally hallucinations and the high cost of inference. However, existing vector databases either cater to niche applications with lowlatency in-memory search, or oﬀer sophisticated data management capabilities but at the cost of low performance. \nTo address these limitations, we propose  GaussDB-Vector , a high-performance, real-time persistent vector database that excels in low-latency scalable search, real-time inserts and deletes, high availability, large-scale distributed search, and hybrid scalar-vector ﬁltered search capabilities. These features are primarily achieved through an innovative storage architecture designed for a graphbased vector index, optimized for I/O operations and adaptable across various dataset sizes and dimensions, complemented by novel buﬀering strategies to further reduce I/O burdens.  GaussDBVector  supports product quantization, parallel search, and hardware acceleration via SIMD, GPUs, and NPUs in order to further accelerate queries.

    "abstract": "Vector databases are designed to e￿ectively store, organize, and re- trieve high-dimensional vectors, enabling faster and more accurate querying and analysis. This study highlights that the performance of cutting-edge vector databases hinges on their pro￿ciency in managing heterogeneous data embedding and handling compound queries. The former task revolves around converting varied data types into a cohesive vector format, while the latter involves pro- cessing multimodal or single-modal queries with precise constraints. The paper advocates for evaluating these dual tasks within an in- tegrated benchmark framework. However, state-of-the-art vector database benchmarks overlook heterogeneous data embedding and compound queries, creating a gap in evaluating vector database performance.\nTo address this gap, we introduce BigVectorBench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate vector database performance. BigVec- torBench contributes by de￿ning and evaluating the embedding performance of heterogeneous data. Additionally, it abstracts com- pound queries, which are increasingly used in real-world appli- cations, replacing unimodal vector searches. Our rigorous evalu- ations validate the two design decisions of BigVectorBench and identify performance bottlenecks of mainstream vector databases.

    "abstract": "Characterizing graph properties is fundamental to the analysis and to our understanding of real-world networked systems. The  local clustering coefficient , and the more-recent,  local closure coefficient , capture powerful properties that are essential in a large number of applications, ranging from graph embeddings to graph partitioning. Such coefficients capture the local density of the neighborhood of each node, considering incident triangle structures and paths of size 2. For this reason, we refer to these coefficients collectively as local triadic coefficients . \nIn this work, we consider the novel and fundamental problem of efficiently computing the  average  of local triadic coefficients, over a given  partition  of the nodes of the input graph into a set of disjoint  buckets . The  average local triadic coefficients  of the nodes in each bucket provide a better insight into the interplay of graph structure and the properties of the nodes associated to each bucket. Unfortunately, exact computation, which requires listing all triangles in a graph, is infeasible for large networks. Hence, we focus on obtaining  highly-accurate probabilistic estimates . \nWe develop T riad , an adaptive algorithm based on sampling, which can be used to estimate the average local triadic coefficients for a partition of the nodes into buckets. T riad  is based on a new class of unbiased estimators, and non-trivial bounds on its sample complexity, enabling the efficient computation of highly accurate estimates. Finally, we show how T riad  can be efficiently used in practice on large networks, and we present a case study showing that average local triadic coefficients can capture highorder patterns over collaboration networks.",

    "title": "TUCKET: A Tensor Time Series Data Structure for Efficient and Accurate Factor Analysis over Time Ranges",
    "abstract": "Given an evolving tensor time series and multiple time ranges, how can we compute Tucker decomposition for each time range efficiently and accurately? Tucker decomposition has been widely used in a variety of applications to obtain latent factors of tensor data. For example, Tucker decomposition on air pollution data allows us to analyze and compare air pollution patterns between different locations during different periods of time. In these applications, a common need is to compute Tucker decomposition for a given time range. Furthermore, real-world tensor time series are typically evolving in the time dimension. Such needs call for a data structure that can efficiently and accurately support range queries of Tucker decomposition and stream updates. Unfortunately, existing methods do not support either range queries or stream updates. For methods that do not support range queries, they have to re-compute from scratch for each query. Not until 2021 has a data structure called Zoom-Tucker been proposed to support range queries via block-wise preprocessing. However, Zoom-Tucker does not support stream updates and, more critically, suffers from a reluctant efficiency–accuracy tradeoff — a large block size causes inaccuracy, while a small block size leads to inefficiency. This challenging problem has remained open for years prior to our work. To solve this challenging problem, we propose TUCKET, a data structure that can efficiently and accurately handle both range queries and stream updates. Our key idea is to design a new data structure that we call a stream segment tree by generalizing the segment tree, a data structure that was originally invented for computational geometry. For a range query of length 𝐿, our TUCKET can find 𝑂 (log 𝐿) nodes (called the hit set) from the tree and efficiently stitch their preprocessed decompositions to answer the range query. We also propose an algorithm to optimally prune the hit set via an approximation of subtensor decomposition. For the 𝑇 -th stream update, our TUCKET modifiesonlyamortized𝑂(1)nodesandonly𝑂(log𝑇)nodesinthe worst case. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our TUCKET consistently achieves the highest efficiency and accuracy across four large-scale datasets. Our TUCKET achieves at least 3 times lower latency and at least 1.4 times smaller reconstruction error than Zoom-Tucker on all datasets.

    "abstract": "We present CEDAR, a system for cost-efficient, data-driven claim verification. CEDAR takes as input a collection of text documents, containing claims that can be verified from relational data. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to map claims to SQL queries that can be used for claim verification. While LLMs like GPT4 are nowadays able to map claims to queries with high accuracy, using them is expensive. This is why CEDAR implements multiple verification approaches, ranging from zero-shot LLM invocations to iterative, agent-based approaches, that realize different tradeoffs between accuracy and costs. The system may apply multiple methods to the same claim, starting with cheaper methods and resorting to more expensive versions in case of failures. CEDAR uses cost-based optimization to derive an optimal order of verification methods and an optimal number of re-tries (with randomization) for each method, enabling users to trade costs for accuracy via tuning parameters. The experiments on real data, including newspaper and Wikipedia articles, show that CEDAR achieves significantly higher accuracy than prior methods for data-driven fact-checking.",

    "abstract": "Renewable Energy Sources ( RES s) are monitored by many highquality sensors that produce vast amounts of high-frequency time series data. This can be used to increase the renewable energy production and longevity of the  RES s, e.g., yaw misalignment detection and predictive maintenance for wind turbines. It is currently not possible for wind turbine manufacturers and owners to use this data due to limits on bandwidth and storage that are infeasible to increase. Thus, they store simple aggregates which remove valuable outliers and fluctuations. As a remedy, we demonstrate the new model-based Time Series Management System ( TSMS ) ModelarDB. The participants can experience how ModelarDB ingests time series on the edge and compresses them as  segments  with metadata and so-called  models . The models represent values within a user-defined absolute or relative error bound (even 0 or 0%). Participants can adjust many parameters and see how the segments are transferred to the cloud using much less bandwidth and storage than other popular solutions like Apache Parquet and Apache TsFile, e.g., up to 90%–99% less than Apache Parquet. Participants can analyze the time series on the edge, in the cloud, and on the client using SQL or Python. On the client, ModelarDB runs in-process to integrate with, e.g., Python. Thus, participants can see how ModelarDB efficiently manages high-frequency time series across edge, cloud, and client.",

In contrast to prior algorithmic work that focuses on Select-Project-Join-Union queries, ours is the first practical approach for queries with aggregates. It relies on two novel optimizations that are essential for its practicality and significantly improve the runtime performance already for queries without aggregates. The first optimization exploits the observation that many input tuples have the same contribution to the query result, so it is enough to compute the contribution of one of them. The second optimization uses the gradient of the query lineage to compute the contributions of all tuples with the same complexity as for one of them. Experiments with a million instances over 3 databases show that our approach achieves up to 3 orders of magnitude runtime improvements over the state-of-the-art for queries without aggregates, and that it is practical for aggregate queries.",

    "abstract": "Modern wind turbines are monitored by sensors that generate massive amounts of high frequency time series that are ingested on the edge and then transferred to the cloud where they are stored and analyzed. This results in at least four challenges: (1) Limited hardware makes efficient ingestion necessary to keep up; (2) Limited bandwidth makes data compression necessary; (3) High storage costs as all data must be stored; and (4) Low data quality due to lossy compression methods without error bounds. Practitioners currently use solutions that only solve some of these. In this paper, we evaluate the Time Series Management System ModelarDB, a solution that meets all four challenges by efficiently managing time series across the entire pipeline. We compare it to three commonly used alternatives and evaluate different aspects of them in a realistic edge-to-cloud scenario with real-life datasets. For lossless compression, ModelarDB achieves up to 2x better compression and 1.2x better transfer efficiency. For lossy compression, ModelarDB achieves up to 4.6x better compression and 10x better transfer efficiency, or similar compression with orders of magnitude less error.",

    "title": "LEADRE: Multi-Faceted Knowledge Enhanced LLM Empowered Display Advertisement Recommender System",
    "abstract": "Display advertising plays a crucial role in benefiting advertisers, publishers, and users. Traditional display advertising systems employ a multi-stage architecture comprising retrieval, coarse ranking, ranking, and re-ranking. However, conventional retrieval methods primarily rely on ID-based learning-to-rank mechanisms, often underutilizing the content information of ads, like ads’ title, and description. This limitation reduces the ability to generate diverse and relevant recommendation lists. \nTo address this challenge, we propose leveraging the extensive world knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, effectively integrating LLMs into advertising systems presents three key challenges:  (i) How to accurately capture user interests ,  (ii) How to bridge the knowledge gap between LLMs and advertising systems , and (iii) How to efficiently deploy LLMs at scale . To overcome these challenges, we introduce  LEADRE —the  L LM  E mpowered Display  AD vertisement  RE commender system. LEADRE consists of three core components.

    "abstract": "Trusted execution environment (TEE) oﬀers a promising approach to building encrypted databases, which keep data conﬁdential for users. However, designing an eﬃcient index for TEE databases remains a signiﬁcant challenge. Due to the limited enclave memory and system call support in enclaves, traditional indexes incur massive context switches (including enclave entry and exiting), which cause performance regression. Existing approaches, such as introducing rich execution environment (REE) buﬀer pools or index parameter optimization, may not alleviate these problems eﬀectively. To address these limitations, we propose  LETIndex , an eﬃcient learned dynamic index designed for TEE databases.  LETIndex adopts LSM-structured Piecewise Geometric Model (PGM) indexes and an adaptive prefetch mechanism to support lookup, range queries, and updates with signiﬁcantly reduced context switches and disk I/O overhead.

    "abstract": "Log data is a vital resource for capturing system events and states. With the increasing complexity and widespread adoption of modern software systems and IoT devices, the daily volume of log generation has surged to tens of petabytes, leading to significant collection and storage costs. To address this challenge, lossless log compression has emerged as an effective solution, enabling substantial resource savings without compromising log information. In this paper, we first conduct a characterization study on extensive public log datasets and identify four key observations. Building on these insights, we propose LogLite, a lightweight, plug-and-play, streaming lossless compression algorithm designed to handle both TEXT and JSON logs throughout their life cycle. LogLite requires no predefined rules or pre-training and is inherently adaptable to evolving log structures. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, LogLite achieves Pareto optimality in most scenarios, delivering an average improvement of up to 67.8% in compression ratio and up to  2 . 7 ×  in compression speed.",

    "title": "HAWK: A Workload-driven Hierarchical Deadlock Detection Approach in Distributed Database System",
    "abstract": "Distributed databases are widely used in various fields, such as financial services and e-commerce. These businesses generally exhibit characteristics of large-scale and rapid growth. However, these business systems often suffer from deadlocks that prevent them from operating normally for extended periods. Traditional deadlock detection methods face challenges in scalability and efficiency, especially as the number of nodes increases. Therefore, deadlock detection has always been a research area in distributed databases. \nIn this paper, we introduce an efficient deadlock detection algorithm called HAWK, leveraging a   H ierarchical   A pproach based on   W or K load modeling. Our algorithm addresses these issues by constructing a dynamic hierarchical detection tree that adapts to transaction patterns, significantly reducing time complexity and communication overhead. HAWK first models the workload and generates a  predicted access graph  (PAG), transforming the problem of partitioning detection task in the basic hierarchical detection into partition detection zone (DZ) in the PAG by a graph-cutting algorithm. Then, leveraging the properties of strongly connected components (SCCs) and deadlock cycles, the SCC-cut algorithm naturally partitions the system-wide deadlock detection into multiple non-intersecting detection zones, thereby enhancing detection efficiency. We used the greedy SCC-cut algorithm to perform a more fine-grained partitioning of the complex PAG. Finally, by periodically sampling and updating the hierarchical structure, the algorithm remains responsive to dynamic workload variations, ensuring efficient detection. Our approach outperforms both centralized and distributed methods, offering a more efficient and adaptive solution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HAWK algorithm, showing significant reductions in the duration of the deadlock and improved system throughput.

    "title": "Streaming View: An Efficient Data Processing Engine for Modern Real-time Data Warehouse of Alibaba Cloud",
    "abstract": "Real-time data warehouses are essential for modern applications. Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) as a fundamental component of ofﬂine data warehouses also provides crucial support within realtime data warehouses. Among various traditional ETL approaches, Lambda and Kappa have emerged as classic real-time data processing solutions due to their freshness and query performance, which best meet business demands. However, both of them often require the integration of external stream processing engines, introducing challenges related to complexity, eﬃciency, and consistency. ZeroETL has emerged as an approach to address these issues. Nevertheless, existing ZeroETL-based solutions primarily emphasize the implementation of extraction and loading, resulting in limitations in handling transformation. Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) oﬀers an alternative that can enhance ZeroETL. However, existing IVM implementations often focus on query acceleration rather than supporting high-throughput, complex real-time workloads. \nTo address these challenges, we propose Streaming View, an eﬃcient real-time data processing engine integrated within AnalyticDB of Alibaba Cloud. Unlike existing solutions, Streaming View supports high-throughput, complex data processing for realtime streaming ETL workloads. Furthermore, it can be leveraged to optimize ZeroETL-based approaches by enhancing transformation capabilities. We design tailored algorithms and optimizations for diverse syntaxes and high-throughput scenarios, ensuring the system meets complex application needs. By integrating incremental computation into the data warehouse, Streaming View reduces complexity, ensures data consistency, and boosts performance, offering a robust solution for real-world applications. Experiments show Streaming View improves processing performance by up to 7x and 20x over traditional ETL and IVM methods, respectively, and addresses complex scenarios unsolved by existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Many linearizable local read algorithms have been proposed to minimize the read latency of strongly consistent distributed databases deployed in geo-distributed networks. These algorithms do so by enabling reads to be performed immediately against any process’ copy of the database in the best case. However, as our analysis shows, worst-case read latency at every process with all existing algorithms is at least the network’s relative diameter in terms of the maximum message delay minus a known lower bound on message delay between any two processes. We then show that by leveraging the asymmetric message delays of geo-distributed networks, worstcase read latency can be below the network’s relative diameter at processes close to the leader or the network’s center by presenting two new linearizable local read algorithms. Our experimental evaluation shows that these new algorithms reduce worst-case read latency by up to 50x compared to existing ones.",

    "abstract": "AI-augmented data processing systems (DPSs)  integrate large language models (LLMs) into query pipelines, allowing powerful semantic operations on structured and unstructured data. However, the reliability (a.k.a. trust) of these systems is fundamentally challenged by the potential for LLMs to produce errors, limiting their adoption in critical domains. To help address this reliability bottleneck, we introduce  semantic integrity constraints (SICs) —a declarative abstraction for specifying and enforcing correctness conditions over LLM outputs in semantic queries. SICs generalize traditional database integrity constraints to semantic settings, supporting common types of constraints, such as grounding, soundness, and exclusion, with both reactive and proactive enforcement strategies. \nWe argue that SICs provide a foundation for building reliable and auditable AI-augmented data systems. Specifically, we present a system design for integrating SICs into query planning and runtime execution and discuss its realization in AI-augmented DPSs. To guide and evaluate our vision, we outline several design goals—covering criteria around expressiveness, runtime semantics, integration, performance, and enterprise-scale applicability—and discuss how our framework addresses each, along with open research challenges.",

    "abstract": "Key-value separation is used in LSM-tree to store large values in separate log files to reduce write amplification but requires garbage collection to recycle invalid values. Existing LSM-tree typically adopts a static policy to recycle obsolete values, struggling to achieve low write amplification as it is challenging to predefine the static parameters for garbage collection. In this work we propose DumpKV, a learning-based lifetime-aware garbage collection mechanism which achieves lower write amplification. DumpKV trains a machine learning model based on the access history of keys and accordingly uses the lightweight model to predict the lifetime of each key, where the predicted lifetime can be used to guide the garbage collection. To reduce the interference to write throughput introduced by garbage collection, DumpKV conducts feature collection during L0-L1 compaction, leveraging the fact that LSM-tree is small under KV separation. Experimental results show that DumpKV reduces GC write size by 25.7%-53.3% in real-world workloads and 19%-65% in synthetic workloads compared to baseline key-value separation LSM-tree KV stores with small feature storage overhead.",

    "title": "Efficient Graph Data Access for Out-of-Memory GPU Streaming Graph Processing",
    "abstract": "Leveraging GPUs’ high parallelism can signi!cantly improve the real-time computation effciency of streaming graph processing. However, when a large-scale graph exceeds GPU memory capacity, CPU-GPU cooperative processing often results in substantial and irregular CPU-to-GPU data transfer overhead. This stems from the extensive redundant graph accesses during continuous computation, which can hardly be addressed by existing solutions. In this work, we present Grapin, an out-of-memory GPU streaming graph processing system designed to minimize graph data transfer via two effective techniques for eliminating redundant accesses: (1) Extending advanced incremental processing algorithms to GPUs by converting their heavyweight data dependency processing into GPU-friendly forms, eliminating redundant graph accesses from the computation side; and (2) providing a lightweight yet efficient GPU hot subgraph management framework that !nely caches the frequently accessed dynamic subgraphs in a vertex-centric manner. Experimental results demonstrate that Grapin can efficiently process large-scale streaming graphs with billions of edges on a single NVIDIA A5000 GPU. Enabling incremental computation reduces data transfer by 61%, and the integration of GPU hot subgraph reuse further reduces the remaining transfer by 72%, resulting in a total reduction of 89%. Compared with CPU-based solutions, Grapin achieves speedups ranging from 1.8x to 96.9x (17.9x on average).",

    "title": "Accurate and Fast Approximate Graph Pattern Mining at Scale",
    "abstract": "Approximate graph pattern mining (A-GPM) is an important data analysis tool for numerous graph-based applications. There exist sampling-based A-GPM systems to provide automation and general-sampling-based A-GPM systems to provide automation and generalization over a wide variety of use cases. Despite improved usability, there are two major obstacles that prevent existing A-GPM systems being adopted in practice. First, the termination mechanism that decides when to terminate sampling lacks theoretical backup on confidence, and performs significantly unstable and thus slow in practice. Second, they particularly suffer poor performance when dealing with the “needle-in-the-hay” cases, because a huge number of samples are required to converge, given the extremely low hit rate of their lazy-pruning strategy and fixed sampling schemes. \nWe build ScaleGPM, an accurate and fast A-GPM system that removes the two obstacles. First, we propose a novel on-the-fly con-removes the two obstacles. First, we propose a novel on-the-fly convergence detection mechanism to achieve stable termination and provide theoretical guarantee on the confidence, with negligible online overhead. Second, we propose two techniques to deal with the “needle-in-the-hay” problem,  eager-verify  and  hybrid sampling . Our eager-verify method drastically improves sampling hit rate by pruning unpromising candidates as early as possible. Hybrid sam-pruning unpromising candidates as early as possible. Hybrid sampling further improves performance by automatically choosing the better scheme between fine-grained and coarse-grained sampling schemes. Experiments show that our online convergence detection mechanism can precisely detect convergence, and results in stable and rapid termination with theoretically guaranteed confidence. We also show the effectiveness of eager-verify in improving the hit rate, and the scheme-selection mechanism in correctly choosing the better scheme for various cases. Overall, ScaleGPM achieves an  geomean  average of 565 ×  (up to 610169 × ) speedup over the state-of-the-art A-GPM system, Arya. In particular, ScaleGPM han-state-of-the-art A-GPM system, Arya. In particular, ScaleGPM handles billion-scale graphs in seconds, where existing systems either run out of memory or fail to complete in hours.",

    "title": "SQL:Trek Automated Index Design at Airbnb",
    "abstract": "Automating index design has been an active area of research for  decades due to the significant impact that indexes have on query  performance and database efficiency. Existing approaches range  from brute-force search to cost-based optimizations and, more  recently, machine learning techniques. However, many suffer from  high computational costs, reliance on inaccurate cost models, or the  need for deep integration with database internals.      We introduce SQL:Trek, a time-efficient tool for automated index  design that operates entirely as an external utility. SQL:Trek  leverages query compiler cost models to identify effective indexes  while mitigating false positives through execution on a lightweight  simulation database. This approach enables fast, iterative index  selection without modifying database internals, making it broadly  applicable across relational databases, including most MySQL â  and  PostgreSQL â  derivative databases.    Our evaluation demonstrates that SQL:Trek delivers significant  query performance improvements while keeping index selection  computationally efficient, with most workloads analyzed in under  five minutes. Unlike many cost-based what-if analysis methods,  SQL:Trek significantly improved performance of many production  workloads while avoiding the majority of detrimental index  recommendations caused by optimizer misestimates.  These results  highlight SQL:Trek as a practical, scalable solution for automated  index tuning in modern database environments.

    "title": "ShaRP: Explaining Rankings and Preferences with Shapley Values",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic decisions in critical domains such as hiring, college admissions, and lending are often based on rankings. Given the impact of these decisions on individuals, organizations, and population groups, it is essential to understand them—to help individuals improve their ranking position, design better ranking procedures, and ensure legal compliance. In this paper, we argue that explainability methods for classification and regression, such as SHAP, are insufficient for ranking tasks, and present ShaRP—Shapley Values for Rankings and Preferences—a framework that explains the contributions of features to various aspects of a ranked outcome. \nShaRP computes feature contributions for various ranking-specific profit functions, such as rank and top- 𝑘 , and also includes a novel Shapley value-based method for explaining pairwise preference outcomes. We provide a flexible implementation of ShaRP, capable of efficiently and comprehensively explaining ranked and pairwise outcomes over tabular data, in score-based ranking and learning-torank tasks. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation methodology for ranking explainability methods, showing through qualitative, quantitative, and usability studies that our rank-aware QoIs offer complementary insights, scale effectively, and help users interpret ranked outcomes in practice.

    "title": "VecCity: A Taxonomy-guided Library for Map Entity Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Electronic maps consist of diverse entities, such as points of interest (POIs), road segments, and land parcels, playing a vital role in applications like ITS and LBS. Map entity representation learning (MapRL) generates versatile and reusable data representations, providing essential tools for efficiently managing and utilizing map entity data. Despite the progress in MapRL, two key challenges constrain further development. First, existing research is fragmented, with models classified by the type of map entity, limiting the reusability of techniques across different tasks. Second, the lack of unified benchmarks makes systematic evaluation and comparison of models difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel taxonomy for MapRL that organizes models based on functional modules—such as encoders, pre-training tasks, and downstream tasks—rather than by entity type. Building on this taxonomy, we present a taxonomy-driven library,  VecCity , which offers easy-to-use interfaces for encoding, pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The library integrates datasets from nine cities and reproduces 21 mainstream MapRL models, establishing the first standardized benchmarks for the field. VecCity also allows users to modify and extend models through modular components, facilitating seamless experimentation. Our comprehensive experiments cover multiple types of map entities and evaluate 21  VecCity  pre-built models across various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of  VecCity  in streamlining model development and provide insights into the impact of various components on performance. By promoting modular design and reusability,  VecCity  offers a unified framework to advance research and innovation in MapRL. The code is available at https://github.com/Bigscity-VecCity/VecCity.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains have gained wide adoption for secure data processing. As blockchain data volumes grow, the demand for efficient data analysis, especially aggregate queries, becomes increasingly critical. However, current blockchains lack native support for efficient analytical query processing, forcing users to either maintain full replicas or rely on third-party services without integrity guarantees. \nIn this paper, we propose an efficient framework, Merkle Bloom Filter Tree ( MBFT ), for authenticated aggregate queries that combine boolean keywords and range predicates on blockchains. At its core is a Bloom filter-based authenticated data structure that supports both types of predicates, constructed per block for efficient transaction indexing. For temporal predicates, we optimize time window queries through value pruning and block consolidation. We design a novel Merge Bloom Filter ( MBF ) for space-efficient handling of dynamic sets during query authentication. We provide a theoretical analysis of the storage overhead caused by the Bloom filter’s false positive rates. Our framework employs data sketches to support various aggregate operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that  MBFT  has improved the query speed by up to 286 ×  compared to state-of-the-art authenticated query solutions.",

    "abstract": "In aggregation queries, predicate parameters often reveal user intent. Protecting these parameters is critical for user privacy, regardless of whether the database is public or private. While most existing works focus on private data settings, we address a public data setting where the server has access to the database. Current solutions for this setting either require additional setups (e.g., noncolluding servers, hardware enclaves) or are ineﬃcient for practical workloads. Furthermore, they often do not support range predicates or boolean combinations commonly seen in real-world use cases. \nTo address these limitations, we built HADES, a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) based private aggregation system for public data that supports point, range predicates, and boolean combinations. Our one-round HADES protocol eﬃciently generates predicate indicators by leveraging the plaintext form of public data records. It introduces a novel elementwise-mapping operation and an optimized reduction algorithm, achieving latency eﬃciency within a limited noise budget. Our highly scalable, multi-threaded implementation improves performance over previous one-round FHE solutions by 204x to 6574x on end-to-end TPC-H queries, reducing aggregation time on 1M records from 15 hours to 38 seconds.",

    "abstract": "By adaptive indexing , an index grows dynamically and progressively through query processing. This mode of index-building, well explored over the past fifteen years, proves especially useful in exploratory scenarios where prebuilt indexes do not pay off the time to construct them, as the query workload variably focuses on particular areas of the search space, or the data become quickly obsolete. Despite a significant body of work in multidimensional adaptive indexing, there remains a gap in compa rative studies that evaluate these methods on equal terms in a wide spectrum of settings, including data types, distributions, sizes, and workload patterns. This work fills this gap with a comprehensive benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the performance, strengths, and limitations of existing multidimensional adaptive indexing methods across diverse scenarios, contributing valuable insights that complement previous works. Further, we suggest supplementary technical extensions that enhance the efficiency of existing methods.",

    "abstract": "We present Apache Flink 2.0, an evolution of the popular stream processing system’s architecture that decouples computation from state management. Flink 2.0 relies on a remote distributed ﬁle system (DFS) for primary state storage and uses local disks as a secondary cache, with state updates streamed continuously and directly to the DFS. To address the latency implications of remote storage, Flink 2.0 incorporates an asynchronous runtime execution model. Furthermore, Flink 2.0 introduces ForSt, a novel state store featuring a uniﬁed ﬁle system that enables faster and lightweight checkpointing, recovery, and reconﬁguration with minimal intrusion to the existing Flink runtime architecture. Using a comprehensive set of Nexmark benchmarks and a large-scale stateful production workload, we evaluate Flink 2.0’s large-state processing, checkpointing, and recovery mechanisms. Our results show signiﬁcant performance improvements and reduced resource utilization compared to the baseline Flink 1.20 implementation. Speciﬁcally, we observe up to  94%  reduction in checkpoint duration, up to  49 ×  faster recovery after failures or a rescaling operation, and up to  50%  cost savings.",

    "title": "Agamotto: Scheduling of Deadline-Oriented Incremental Query Execution under Uncertain Resource Price",
    "abstract": "Incremental query processing is widely used in data warehouses and streaming systems. While many optimization techniques are developed to generate incremental query plans, the scheduling support for incremental processing remains preliminary. Typically, execution is triggered with fixed frequencies specified by the user. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling problem for incremental query execution under a deadline, assuming the resource has a fluctuating and unforeseen price. We propose two naive solutions as well as a prophet scheduler that foresees the future. We present an end-to-end system  Agamotto  that models future probabilities offline with a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and makes cost-based and dynamic scheduling decisions online. We show how  Agamotto can be extended to handle a workflow of dependent queries, so that they can all incrementally execute in an asynchronous fashion. Experiments show that  Agamotto  consistently outperforms the naive solutions, and the achieved cost is on average 10x closer to the theoretical lower bound provided by the prophet scheduler.",

    "title": "ParSEval: Plan-aware Test Database Generation for SQL Equivalence Evaluation",
    "abstract": "Deciding query equivalence has played an essential role in many real-world applications, including evaluating the accuracy of textto-SQL models, where one needs to compare model-generated queries against ground truth queries. Although query equivalence is undecidable in general, researchers have developed two significant approaches to check query equivalence: formal verification-based and test-case-based. Verification-based solutions ensure correctness but may lack support for advanced SQL features and cross-database adaptability. Test cases are versatile but suffer from ad-hoc constraints and potential incorrectness (false positives). \nIn this paper, we propose  ParSEval , a  Plan-aware SQL Equivalence evaluation framework to generate test database instances for given queries. We observed that existing test data generation methods fail to fully explore the query structure. To address this limitation, ParSEval  formally models specific behaviors of each query operator and considers all possible execution paths of the logical query plan by adapting the notion of branch coverage. We validated the effectiveness and efficiency of  ParSEval  on four datasets with AI-generated and human-crafted queries. The experimental results show that  ParSEval  supports up to 40% more query pairs than state-of-the-art verification-based approaches. Compared to existing test-case-based approaches,  ParSEval  reveals more nonequivalent pairs while being 21 ×  faster.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents  PathCE , a path-centric cardinality estimation framework for subgraph matching.  PathCE  improves estimation accuracy by utilizing statistics from short graph queries. At its core is a novel data structure called the  path-centric summary graph  ( PSG ), which captures short path query statistics from a data graph  𝐺 and represents them in a new graph  G . Given a graph query  𝑄 and a PSG  graph  G  for  𝐺 ,  PathCE  decomposes  𝑄 into a simpler query  Q , where each edge in  Q  corresponds to a sub-path query in  𝑄 with statistics included in  G .  PathCE  estimates the cardinality using  Q and  G , requiring significantly fewer estimation iterations while ensuring that the estimate remains an upper bound on the true cardinality of  𝑄 ( 𝐺 ) . It also includes  PSGBuilder , a parallelly scalable algorithm that constructs  PSG ’s for any given graph in linear time, efficiently scaling with the number of processors. Empirical results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that  PathCE  outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, estimation latency, and summary construction efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Memory-based temporal graph neural network (MTGNN) models are eﬀective for predicting temporal graphs by using node memory and message-passing modules to capture temporal and structural information, respectively. However, distributed training for large graphs presents challenges such as accuracy loss and decreased eﬃciency due to remote features and memory transmission. Despite improvements in MTGNN system optimizations, issues like dynamic load imbalances, communication overhead, and memory staleness persist. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MemShare, a distributed MTGNN system. MemShare introduces a novel shared node memory paradigm that utilizes a small subset of shared nodes across machines and GPUs to reduce distributed communication for memory management. It incorporates techniques like shared nodescentric graph partitioning, shared nodes-aware boundary decay sampling, and shared nodes-targeted synchronous smoothing aggregation. Experiments show that MemShare outperforms existing distributed MTGNN systems in accuracy and training eﬃciency.",

Empowered by the inherent advantages of machine learning, the learning-based techniques show the generalization ability and better performance in many scenarios, including graph data management and graph query processing. Despite the efficiency and accuracy brought by machine learning techniques, machine learning for graph database models still face several critical challenges, including scalability and adaptability.

GNN tensor parallelism eliminates cross-worker vertex dependencies by partitioning features instead of graph structures. Different workers are assigned training tasks on different feature slices with the same dimensional size, leading to a complete load balance. We achieve efficient GNN tensor parallelism through two critical functions. Firstly, we employ a generalized decoupled train-critical functions. Firstly, we employ a generalized decoupled training framework to decouple NN operations from graph aggregation operations, significantly reducing the communication overhead caused by NN operations which must be computed using complete features. Secondly, we employ a memory-efficient task scheduling strategy to support the training of large graphs exceeding single GPU memory, while further improving performance by overlapping communication and computation.

This methodology of using AI to generate query workloads breaks new ground, not only in its ability to cheaply ($15) generate huge volumes (22 MB) of realistic queries but especially because it greatly expands the amount of SQL functionality and query constructions that is covered, compared to human-written SQL benchmarks such as TPC-H, TPC-DS, and JOB. The use cases of SQLStorm that we think will advance data systems most are: (i) improving SQL compatibility between systems, (ii) increasing system quality by identifying crashes/errors and ﬁxing those, (iii) improving cardinality estimators and query optimizers, by identifying trends and opportunities (queries where other systems do much better), as well as (iv) overall system performance, both in terms of speed and robustness.",

    "title": "Detecting Schema-Related Logic Bugs in Relational DBMSs via Equivalent Database Construction",
    "abstract": "Relational Database Management Systems (DBMSs) provide flexible DDL (Data Definition Language) statements that enable the creation, modification, and deletion of database schemas. In addition to database schemas, relational DBMSs typically manage various schema-related information internally, e.g., schema changes, tablespace allocation, and block-level data layout. However, incorrect implementations related to schema-related information maintenance and utilization can introduce schema-related logic bugs. These bugs can cause DQL (Data Query Language) statements to return incorrect query results and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements to create incorrect database states. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting logic bugs in DQL statements, but are ineffective in detecting schema-related logic bugs. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel and general testing approach, DDLCheck , to effectively detect schema-related logic bugs in relational DBMSs. We first generate a complex DDL sequence  𝑠𝑒𝑞 𝑔𝑒𝑛 that consists of various types of DDL statements, and then synthesize a rather simple DDL sequence  𝑠𝑒𝑞 𝑠𝑦𝑛 , which utilizes  CREATE statements to create the same database schema as  𝑠𝑒𝑞 𝑔𝑒𝑛 . Executing the same SQL statements on the two databases created by  𝑠𝑒𝑞 𝑔𝑒𝑛 and  𝑠𝑒𝑞 𝑠𝑦𝑛 should yield the same execution results. Any discrepancy between their execution results indicates a schema-related logic bug. To improve the testing efficiency of  DDLCheck , we further design a DDL-sequence-oriented testing optimization strategy, which can help  DDLCheck  explore diverse schema-related information and detect schema-related logic bugs quickly. We implement and evaluate  DDLCheck  on six widely-used relational DBMSs. We have detected 34 bugs in these DBMSs, of which 29 bugs have been confirmed as previously unknown bugs and 9 bugs have been fixed.",

Tuskflow employs a deterministic protocol that safely reorders regular transactions around mammoths within an epoch. Our protocol supports parallel mammoth execution inspired by graph-parallel algorithms. To minimize con$icts with regular transactions, Tuskflow introduces query- and workload-aware optimizations, including graph entity tagging and partitioning.

We conduct an extensive experimental analysis with MaxBench across different combinations of GPU models and interconnects on various data analytics workloads.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose, analyze and empirically validate a lazyupdate approach to maintain accurate approximations of the 2-hop neighborhoods of dynamic graphs resulting from sequences of edge insertions. \nWe first show that under random input sequences, our algorithm exhibits an optimal trade-off between accuracy and insertion cost: it only performs  𝑂 ( 1/𝜀 )  (amortized) updates per edge insertion, while the estimated size of any vertex’s 2-hop neighborhood is at most a factor  𝜀 away from its true value in most cases,  regardless  of the underlying graph topology and for any  𝜀 >  0. \nAs a further theoretical contribution, we explore adversarial scenarios that can force our approach into a worst-case behavior at any given time  𝑡 of interest. We show that while worst-case input sequences do exist, a necessary condition for them to occur is that the  girth  of the graph released up to time  𝑡 be at most 4. \nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on a collection of real, incremental social networks of different sizes, which typically have low girth. Empirical results are consistent with and typically better than our theoretical analysis anticipates. This further supports the robustness of our theoretical findings: forcing our algorithm into a worst-case behavior not only requires topologies characterized by a low girth, but also carefully crafted input sequences that are unlikely to occur in practice. \nCombined with standard sketching techniques, our lazy approach proves an effective and efficient tool to support key neighborhood queries on large, incremental graphs, including neighborhood size, Jaccard similarity between neighborhoods and, in general, functions of the union and/or intersection of 2-hop neighborhoods.",

    "abstract": "Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are widely used for the storage of structured data. To derive insights beyond statistical aggregation, we typically have to extract specific subdatasets from the database using conventional database operations, and then apply deep neural networks (DNN) training and inference on these subdatasets in a separate analytics system. The process can be prohibitively expensive, especially when there are various subdatasets extracted for different analytical purposes. This calls for efficient in-database support of advanced analytical methods.\nIn this paper, we introduce LEADS, a novel SQL-aware dynamic model slicing technique to customize models for specified SQL queries. LEADS improves the predictive modeling of structured data via the mixture of experts (MoE) and maintains efficiency by a SQL-aware gating network. At the core of LEADS is the construction of a general model with multiple expert sub-models trained over the database. The MoE scales up the modeling capacity, enhances effectiveness, and preserves efficiency by activating necessary experts via the SQL-aware gating network during inference. To support in-database analytics, we build an inference extension that integrates LEADS onto PostgreSQL. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LEADS consistently outperforms the baseline models, and the in-database inference extension delivers a considerable reduction in inference latency compared to traditional solutions.",

    "abstract": "Efficient data annotation stands as a significant bottleneck in training contemporary machine learning models. The Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) pipeline presents a solution by utilizing multiple weak supervision sources to automatically label data, thereby expediting the annotation process. Given the varied contributions of these weak supervision sources to the accuracy of PWS, it is imperative to employ a robust and efficient metric for their evaluation. This is crucial not only for understanding the behavior and performance of the PWS pipeline but also for facilitating corrective measures. \nIn this paper, we introduce WeShap values as an evaluation metric. This metric quantifies the average contribution of weak supervision sources within a proxy PWS pipeline, leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of Shapley values. We demonstrate efficient computation of WeShap values using dynamic programming, achieving quadratic computational complexity relative to the number of weak supervision sources. \nOur experiments demonstrate the versatility of WeShap values across various applications, including the identification of beneficial or detrimental labeling functions, refinement of the PWS pipeline, comprehension of the pipeline’s behavior, and scrutinizing specific instances of mislabeled data. Although initially derived from a specific proxy PWS pipeline, we empirically demonstrate the generalizability of WeShap values to other PWS pipeline configurations. Our findings indicate a noteworthy average improvement of 5.0 points in downstream model accuracy through the revision of the PWS pipeline compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the efficacy of WeShap values in enhancing data quality for training machine learning models.",

    "title": "IncrCP: Decomposing and Orchestrating Incremental Checkpoints for Effective Recommendation Model Training",
    "abstract": "Training large models for modern recommendation systems requires a substantial number of computational devices and extended periods. Since it is essential to store model checkpoints throughout the training progress for accuracy debugging or mitigating potential failures, checkpointing systems are widely used. However, given that recommendation models can scale to hundreds of gigabytes or more, existing solutions often introduce significant overhead in terms of both storage and I/O. \nIn this paper, we present IncrCP, a checkpointing system specifically designed for recommendation models. Given that only a small fraction of model parameters are modified in each iteration, IncrCP creatively leverages the incremental checkpointing strategy and overcomes the inherent slow recovery problem. To support recovering all states throughout the training process, while also ensuring efficient storage utilization and rapid recovery, IncrCP proposes the 2-D chunk approach. It proactively records changed parameters in the training process as well as their indexes, extracts parameters according to duplicated indexes as independent chunk files, and then orchestrates these chunks in the 2-dimensional linked list. In this way, IncrCP achieves fast recovery by loading less unnecessary parameters and performing less deduplication during recovery. Furthermore, IncrCP includes a selective extraction approach to reduce I/O by avoiding worthless extractions and a concatenate approach to reduce random disk access when recovery. Evaluations show that IncrCP achieves up to 6.6×  recovery speedup compared to the naive incremental strategy and saves storage space by 60.4% with slight overhead compared to another recovery-friendly strategy.",

    "title": "Unleash the Power of Ellipsis: Accuracy-enhanced Sparse Vector Technique with Exponential Noise",
    "abstract": "The Sparse Vector Technique (SVT) is one of the most fundamental tools in differential privacy (DP). It works as a backbone for adap- tive data analysis by answering a sequence of queries on a given dataset, and gleaning useful information in a privacy-preserving manner. Unlike the typical private query releases that directly pub- licize the noisy query results, SVT is less informative—it keeps the noisy query results to itself and only reveals a binary bit for each query, indicating whether the query result surpasses a predened threshold. To provide a rigorous DP guarantee for SVT, prior works in the literature adopt a conservative privacy analysis by assuming the direct disclosure of noisy query results as in typical private query releases. This approach, however, hinders SVT from achiev- ing higher query accuracy due to an overestimation of the privacy risks, which further leads to an excessive noise injection using the Laplacian or Gaussian noise for perturbation. Motivated by this, we provide a new privacy analysis for SVT by considering its less informative nature. Our analysis results not only broaden the range of applicable noise types for perturbation in SVT, but also identify the exponential noise as optimal among all evaluated noises (which, however, is usually deemed non-applicable in prior works). The main challenge in applying exponential noise to SVT is mitigating the sub-optimal performance due to the bias introduced by noise distributions. To address this, we develop a utility-oriented optimal threshold correction method and an appending strategy, which enhances the performance of SVT by increasing the precision and recall, respectively. The eectiveness of our proposed methods is substantiated both theoretically and empirically, demonstrating signicant improvements up to 50% across evaluated metrics.",

    "title": "Efficiently Joining Large Relations on Multi-GPU Systems",
    "abstract": "Growing data volumes present a mounting challenge to relational joins. GPUs have gained widespread adoption as database accelerators for operators such as joins due to their high instruction throughput and memory bandwidth. Most published GPU-accelerated joins are single-GPU algorithms that do not leverage modern multi-GPU platforms effectively. The few proposed multi-GPU algorithms either fail to exploit the high-speed P2P interconnects between the GPUs or to handle large out-of-core data natively. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous multi-GPU sort-merge join that overcomes both limitations. It is composed of a merge- or radix partitioningbased P2P-enabled multi-GPU  sort  phase, a parallel CPU-based multiway  merge  phase, and a hybrid  join  phase that combines a CPU merge path partition with a binary search-based multi-GPU join strategy. We evaluate our novel multi-GPU join on two platforms with fast NVLink- and NVSwitch-based P2P interconnects. We show that our join outperforms state-of-the-art CPU and GPU baselines regardless of the workload. It outperforms parallel CPU sort-merge and radix-hash joins by up to  15.2 ×  and  5.5 × , respectively. Compared to non-P2P-enabled multi-GPU joins, it achieves speedups of  8.7 ×  (sort-merge) and  2.5 ×  (hybrid-radix). We measure that our join’s hybrid join phase with overlapped copy and compute operations contributes as little as  22%  to its end-to-end runtime. If the input relations are pre-sorted, it is up to  14.4 ×  faster than the hybrid-radix join. Our join scales well with the number of GPUs and benefits from data skew with as much as  12%  shorter join durations.",

    "abstract": "Real-world tasks such as recommending videos tagged  kids  can be reduced to finding  similar  vectors associated with  hard  predicates. This task,  filtered vector search , is challenging as prior state-of-theart graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques degenerate when hard constraints are considered: effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching similar items within a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only items that satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only few items satisfy predicates. \nWe propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06 ×  speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15 ×  memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.",

In this study, we propose a general  M ulti-object I ve framework with contro LL able r I sk for p O rtfolio ma N agement ( MILLION ), which consists of two main phases, i.e., return-related maximization and risk control. Specifically, in the return-related maximization phase, we introduce two auxiliary objectives, i.e., return rate prediction, and return rate ranking, combined with portfolio optimization to remit the overfitting problem and improve the generalization of the trained model to future markets. Subsequently, in the risk control phase, we propose two methods, i.e., portfolio interpolation and portfolio improvement, to achieve fine-grained risk control and fast risk adaption to a user-specified risk level.

In addition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after portfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization, as long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective.

While numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed, many remain unexplored in the time-series domain, and others are unsuitable for streaming scenarios. Moreover, many effective methods require prior knowledge of the number of clusters, a significant limitation when dealing with evolving data streams. To address these challenges, we propose BURST, a principled and general-purpose framework that enables the application of partition-based clustering methods in streaming time-series settings. At its core, BURST integrates AutoKC, a novel, adaptive algorithm for automatically estimating the number of clusters, enhancing robustness to evolving time-series streams. Experimental analyses show that BURST is a robust strategy for real-time time-series clustering, effectively generalizing across different partitioning methods, and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing algorithms.",

BoMB consists of one long-running update transaction and five short transactions that conflict with each other. Experiments using BoMB show that Oze can handle the long-running update transaction while achieving four orders of magnitude higher throughput than state-of-the-art optimistic and multi-version protocols and up to five times higher throughput than pessimistic protocols.

Additionally, we ﬁnd that: (1) Existing methods oﬀer diverse deﬁnitions or descriptions of communities, which require systematic summarization. (2) The methods rely on distinct metrics for limited community assessment. (3) Overhead evaluations of the methods vary and exhibit certain biases. \nTherefore, a comprehensive survey and experimental study are essential to achieve four key objectives: designing a uniﬁed pipeline, clarifying community deﬁnitions, enriching community evaluation, and establishing overhead assessment. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a uniﬁed pipeline for these methods, highlighting techniques. We categorize community deﬁnitions and analyze the relationships between identiﬁed communities. Beyond that, we proposed several community metrics to evaluate the communities comprehensively. Moreover, we introduce a more detailed overhead evaluation approach that considers resource consumption during both the training and search phases. Finally, we employ the proposed community evaluation metrics and overhead assessment framework to evaluate and analyze the methods, examine correlations among metrics, and explore the eﬀects of several commonly used techniques.",

This paper delves into differentially private database synthesis specifically for benchmark publishing scenarios, aiming to produce a synthetic database whose benchmarking factors closely resemble those of the original data. Introducing  PrivBench , an innovative synthesis framework based on sum-product networks (SPNs), we support the synthesis of high-quality benchmark databases that maintain fidelity in both data distribution and query runtime performance while preserving privacy. We validate that PrivBench can ensure database-level DP even when generating multi-relation databases with complex reference relationships. Our extensive experiments show that PrivBench efficiently synthesizes data that maintains privacy and excels in both data distribution similarity and query runtime similarity.",

    "title": "ThriftLLM: On Cost-Effective Selection of Large Language Models for Classification Queries",
    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language content, attracting widespread attention in both industry and academia. An increasing number of services oﬀer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Diﬀerent LLMs demonstrate expertise in diﬀerent domains of queries (e.g., text classiﬁcation queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of diﬀerent scales, complexities, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this, several researchers are investigating strategies for selecting an ensemble of LLMs, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, how to ﬁnd an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance with guarantees. \nIn this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of correctness probability, which we formally deﬁne. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the Optimal Ensemble Selection (OES) problem of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget that maximizes the overall correctness probability. We show that the correctness probability function is non-decreasing and nonsubmodular and provide evidence that the OES problem is likely to be NP-hard. By leveraging a submodular function that upper bounds correctness probability, we develop an algorithm,  ThrifLLM , and prove that it achieves an instance-dependent approximation guarantee with high probability. Our framework functions as a data processing system that selects appropriate LLM operators to deliver high-quality results under budget constraints. It achieves state-ofthe-art performance for text classiﬁcation and entity matching queries on multiple real-world datasets against various baselines in our extensive experimental evaluation, while using a relatively lower cost budget, strongly supporting the eﬀectiveness and superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "Data regulations like GDPR require systems to support data erasure but leave the definition of \"erasure\" open to interpretation. This ambiguity makes compliance challenging, especially in databases where data dependencies can lead to erased data being inferred from remaining data. We formally define a precise notion of data erasure that ensures any inference about deleted data, through dependencies, remains bounded to what could have been inferred before its insertion. We design erasure mechanisms that enforce this guarantee at minimal cost. Additionally, we explore strategies to balance cost and throughput, batch multiple erasures, and proactively compute data retention times when possible. We demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our algorithms using both real and synthetic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods.",

    "abstract": "Database Management Systems (DBMSs) utilize transactions to guarantee data consistency and integrity. Incorrect implementations of transaction processing mechanisms can introduce critical transaction bugs, which can lead to incorrect database states after the involved transactions complete. However, we lack an effective test oracle to determine whether a DBMS produces a correct database state for a given concurrent transaction schedule. \nIn this paper, we propose a general property for concurrent transaction schedules,  write-specific serializability , in which a schedule of concurrent transactions should produce the same database state as a corresponding serial schedule of the same transactions. Through our empirical study on 35 critical transaction bugs collected from six widely-used DBMSs, we find that write-specific serializability can be an effective test oracle to expose critical transaction bugs in DBMSs. We further develop a simple and general transaction testing approach,  WriteCheck , to automatically detect write-specific serializability violations by identifying inconsistencies in the final database states produced by the original transaction schedule and its corresponding serial schedule. We evaluate  WriteCheck  on the latest versions of six production-grade DBMSs, and have found 22 write-specific serializability violations, 11 of which have been confirmed as new critical transaction bugs.",

    "abstract": "Ranking indicators are essential tools for comparing the importance of various entities such as cities or scientists. While extensively used in fields like econometrics and scientometrics, many other domains lack systematic approaches for developing these indicators. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically discovering ranking indicators from very large knowledge graphs. To this end, we formalize the notion of  counting graph pattern  (CG) as a special SPARQL query, and the concept of  ideal ranking indicator  as a CG whose result induces a strict total order on a set of entities. To assess the interestingness of ranking indicators, we employ the proportion of covered entities  along with an inequality measure, namely the Gini coefficient. We further present Algorithm  Ranking Indicator Pattern Miner ( RIPM ) , to efficiently identify interesting ranking indicators for a given field, thanks to pruning techniques for handling the very large search space. Our experimental study shows the effectiveness of our optimizations. It also validates that  RIPM extracts  transparent, diverse, and understandable  indicators through a user survey and a comparison with two baselines. This work has significant implications for fields lacking dedicated communities working on ranking tasks, providing a robust tool to automatically produce ranking indicators, and the associated rankings.",

    "title": "GRewriter: Practical Query Rewriting with Automatic Rule Set Expansion in GaussDB",
    "abstract": "Effectively rewriting a wide range of complex and diverse queries is critical for database systems. Huawei GaussDB has been experiencing limited extensibility of its existing query rewriter. The problem is rooted in the need for one-size-fits-all rewrites by its pipelined rewrite workflow and the source code-level coupling of rewrite logic. This makes it not only difficult to identify generic, broadly applicable rewrites but also engineering-intensive to program them into the system. \nThis paper presents GRewriter, GaussDB’s new bolt-on extensible query rewriter powered by automated rewrite rule discovery. GRewriter sits atop the existing optimizer stack to explore useful rewrites, allowing a variety of rules to coexist and be selected on a per-query basis. A new rule language, G-DSL, is used to express rewrite rules so that the rewrite engine is not coupled with specific rules. To improve rewrite efficiency, a new rule index structure and a rewrite history cache are introduced. Rules in GRewriter are produced by an offline rule generator. With novel enumeration techniques and a new equivalence theorem, our rule generator can efficiently discover formally verified rules that are much more expressive than prior research prototypes. For operational convenience, GRewriter also supports manual rule authoring and interactive management of rules through familiar SQL interfaces. \nGRewriter has been integrated into GaussDB and is gradually rolling out to customers. GRewriter equips GaussDB with over a hundred rules while maintaining negligible overhead ( < 1%). These new rewrite rules have enhanced query performance for two key customer applications, an ERP system and a Banking transaction system, reducing production query latency by up to 99.9%—from 26 seconds to just 17 milliseconds.",

    "abstract": "Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are becoming increasingly important in modern warehouses to cope with the enormous logistic demands of developing e-commerce and the growing operational costs. The key component of implementing such a system is planning the paths of a large horde of AGVs to deliver orders from shelves to packing locations. The existing solutions regard it as a Multi Agent PathFinding (MAPF)  problem, but they can hardly be applied in practice because none of them could satisfy the continuous (temporal), lifelong (future task unknown and keeps appearing), kinematic (acceleration/deceleration/rotation), online (fast response), and scalability (large network, large AGV number, large task number) at the same time. Therefore, we ﬁrst propose an AGV routing framework that can satisfy all these properties with its corresponding routing algorithm. Then, to improve the eﬃciency, we propose the Multi-Hop Conﬂict-Aware Search method (MHCAS) with action combination, MHSC to reduce the search space, and OHSMD to decompose motions such that routing time is reduced by three orders of magnitude. Extensive experimental studies verify the superiority of our methods compared with the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Efficient vector search is a foundational capability of vector databases. However, most prior research overlooks its critical role in federated databases for applications like financial risk control and smart healthcare. In these privacy-sensitive scenarios, a vector search engine must not only deliver high performance but also guarantee privacy across federated databases. Current solutions, however, struggle with scalability for high-dimensional vectors, and offer limited query support. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces FedVSE, a privacy-preserving vector search engine for federated databases. FedVSE supports both KNN and hybrid queries, matching the versatility of modern vector databases. It leverages Intel SGX for hardware-enabled security and offers highly optimized query processing via indexing and pruning.

    "title": "Towards Ideal Temporal Graph Neural Networks: Evaluations and Conclusions after 10,000 GPU Hours",
    "abstract": "Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling dynamic interactions across various domains. The design space of TGNNs is notably complex, given the unique challenges in runtime efficiency and scalability raised by the evolving nature of temporal graphs. We contend that many of the existing works on TGNN modeling inadequately explore the design space, leading to suboptimal designs. Viewing TGNN models through a performance-focused lens often obstructs a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Specifically, benchmarking efforts inherently evaluate models in their original designs and implementations, resulting in unclear accuracy comparisons and misleading runtime. To address these shortcomings, we propose a practical comparative evaluation framework that performs a design space search across well-known TGNN modules based on a unified, optimized code implementation. Using our framework, we make the first efforts towards addressing three critical questions in TGNN design, spending over 10,000 GPU hours: (1) investigating the efficiency of TGNN module designs, (2) analyzing how the effectiveness of these modules correlates with dataset patterns, and (3) exploring the interplay between multiple modules. Key outcomes of this directed investigative approach include demonstrating that the most recent neighbor sampling and attention aggregator outperform uniform neighbor sampling and MLP-Mixer aggregator; Assessing static node memory as an effective node memory alternative, and showing that the choice between static or dynamic node memory should be based on the repetition patterns in the dataset. Our in-depth analysis of the interplay between TGNN modules and dataset patterns should provide a deeper insight into TGNN performance along with potential research directions for designing more general and effective TGNNs.",

    "title": "On LLM-Enhanced Mixed-Type Data Imputation with High-Order Message Passing",
    "abstract": "Missing data imputation, which aims to impute the missing values in the raw datasets, is crucial for modern data-driven models like large language models (LLMs). Despite its importance, existing solutions either 1) only support numerical and categorical data or 2) show an unsatisfactory performance due to their design prioritizing text data and overlooking intrinsic characteristics of tabular data. \nIn this paper, we propose UnIMP, a   Un ified   IMP utation framework that leverages LLM and high-order message passing to enhance the imputation of mixed-type data, including numerical, categorical, and text data. Specifically, we first introduce a celloriented hypergraph to model the table. We then propose BiHMP, an efficient   Bi directional   H igh-order   M essage - P assing network to aggregate global-local and high-order information while capturing the inter-column heterogeneity and intra-column homogeneity. To align the capacity of the LLM with the information aggregated by BiHMP, we introduce Xfusion, which, together with BiHMP, acts as adapters for the LLM. We follow a pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline to train UnIMP, integrating two optimizations: chunking technique, which divides tables into smaller chunks to enhance efficiency; and progressive masking technique, which gradually adapts the model to learn more complex data patterns. Both theoretical proofs and empirical experiments on 10 real-world datasets highlight the superiority of UnIMP over existing techniques.",

    "title": "Truss Decomposition in Hypergraphs",
    "abstract": "Truss decomposition is a fundamental approach in graph theory that focuses on uncovering cohesive subgraphs within networks. However, many networks involve groupwise rather than pairwise relationships and are often represented as hypergraphs. Modeling and capturing  k-truss  in hypergraphs is essential for uncovering tight-knit relationships in such multi-relational networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem of truss decomposition in hypergraph. A  hyper  𝑘 -truss  is a subgraph in which each node is part of at least  𝑘 hyper-triangles. We first introduce a framework for hypertruss decomposition and determine that the most time-consuming component is counting hyper-triangles. To count all hyper-triangles efficiently, we propose an edge-iterator algorithm. To further reduce redundant computations, we present an improved algorithm that combines edge-iterator and node-iterator techniques to prune nonpromising nodes. Next, to handle common nodes in hypergraphs, we develop a novel prefix forest technique to encode all hyperedges and count triangles within this prefix forest. We also propose several optimization strategies that reorder nodes and hyperedges to improve work balancing. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world hypergraph datasets, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.",

This advancement leads to the Anchored Densest Subgraph (ADS) search problem, which finds the subgraph  𝑆 ˆ   with the highest  𝑅 -subgraph density for a given set  𝑅 . Nonetheless, current algorithms for ADS search face signifi-set  𝑅 .

Furthermore, these algorithms require re-computing the ADS whenever the graph is updated, complicating the efficient main-whenever the graph is updated, complicating the efficient maintenance within dynamic graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose the concept of integer  𝑅 -subgraph density and study the problem of finding a subgraph  𝑆 ∗ ⊆ 𝑉 with the highest integer 𝑅 -subgraph density. We reveal that the  𝑅 -subgraph density of  𝑆 ∗ provides an additive approximation to that of ADS with a difference of less than 1, and hence  𝑆 ∗ is termed the Approximate Anchored Densest Subgraph (AADS). For searching the AADS, we present an efficient global algorithm incorporating the re-orientation network flow technique and binary search, operating in a time polynomial to the graph’s size. Additionally, we propose a novel local algorithm using shortest-path-based methods for the max-flow computation from  𝑠 to  𝑡 around  𝑅 , markedly boosting performance in scenarios with larger  𝑅 sets.

    "title": "Cuckoo Heavy Keeper and the balancing act of maintaining heavy hitters in stream processing",
    "abstract": "Finding heavy hitters in databases and data streams is a fundamental problem with applications ranging from network monitoring to database query optimization, machine learning, and more. Approximation algorithms offer practical solutions, but they present tradeoffs involving throughput, memory usage, and accuracy. Moreover, modern applications further complicate these trade-offs by demanding capabilities beyond sequential processing that require both parallel scaling and support for concurrent queries and updates. \nAnalysis of these trade-offs led us to the key idea behind our proposed streaming algorithm,  Cuckoo Heavy Keeper  (CHK). The approach introduces an inverted process for distinguishing frequent from infrequent items, which unlocks new algorithmic synergies that were previously inaccessible with conventional approaches. By further analyzing the competing metrics with a focus on parallelism, we propose an algorithmic framework that balances scalability aspects and provides options to optimize query and insertion efficiency based on their relative frequencies. The framework is capable of parallelizing any heavy-hitter detection algorithm. \nBesides the algorithms’ analysis, we present an extensive evaluation on both real-world and synthetic data across diverse distributions and query selectivity, representing the broad spectrum of application needs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CHK improves throughput by 1.7-5.7 ×  and accuracy by up to four orders of magnitude even under low-skew data and tight memory constraints. These properties allow its parallel instances to achieve near-linear scale-up and low latency for heavy-hitter queries, even under a high query rate. We expect the versatility of CHK and its parallel instances to impact a broad spectrum of tools and applications in large-scale data analytics and stream processing systems.",

    "abstract": "An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and designing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3×- 180×in graph updates and 1.4×- 41.1×in graph computation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Video-Language Models (VideoLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, offering significant potential for flexible and powerful video query systems. These models typically rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which process video frames individually to extract visual embeddings. However, generating embeddings for large-scale videos requires ViT inferencing across numerous frames, posing a major hurdle to real-world deployment and necessitating solutions for integration into scalable video data management systems. This paper introduces  Déjà Vu , a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is  ReuseViT , a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although  ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this,  Déjà Vu  integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains. Evaluations on three VideoLM tasks show that  Déjà Vu  accelerates embedding generation by up to a 2.64 ×  within a 2% error bound, dramatically enhancing the practicality of VideoLMs for large-scale video analytics.",

The key to these optimisations is the notion of  guardedness , by which we impose restrictions on the occurrence of attributes in  GROUP BY clauses and in aggregate expressions.

    "abstract": "Querying and analyzing data in data lakes requires substantial manual intervention, including numerous data preprocessing steps, and often demands complex domain expertise. However, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising solution to these challenges by providing a unified framework for interpreting the heterogeneous datasets within data lakes. In this paper, we demonstrate QueryArtisan, a novel LLM-powered analytical system tailored for data lakes. It enables users to issue complex queries in natural language without the need for domain-specific expertise. The system automatically executes user-submitted queries and performs data processing and analysis based on the query results. QueryArtisan extends beyond traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by generating just-in-time code customized for dataset-specific tasks. A suite of heterogeneous operators is developed to process data across various modalities. In addition, a cost-based query optimization mechanism is integrated to improve the efficiency of the generated code. Furthermore, QueryArtisan can dynamically instantiate multiple agents in response to user-defined analytical requirements to perform further in-depth analysis of the retrieved data.",

    "title": "Improving DBMS Scheduling Decisions with Accurate Performance Prediction on Concurrent Queries",
    "abstract": "Query scheduling is a critical task that directly impacts query performance in database management systems (DBMS). Deeply integrated schedulers, which require changes to DBMS internals, are usually customized for a specific engine and can take months to implement. In contrast, non-intrusive schedulers make coarse-grained decisions, such as controlling query admission and re-ordering query execution, without requiring modifications to DBMS internals. They require much less engineering effort and can be applied across a wide range of DBMS engines, offering immediate benefits to end users. However, most existing non-intrusive scheduling systems rely on simplified cost models and heuristics that cannot accurately model query interactions under concurrency and different system states, possibly leading to suboptimal scheduling decisions. \nThis work introduces  IconqSched , a new, principled non-intrusive scheduler that optimizes the execution order and timing of queries to enhance total end-to-end runtime as experienced by the user — query queuing time plus system runtime. Unlike previous approaches,  IconqSched  features a novel predictor,  Iconq , which treats the DBMS as a black box and accurately estimates the system runtime of concurrently executed queries under different system states. Using these predictions,  IconqSched  is able to capture system runtime variations across different query mixes and system loads. It then employs a greedy scheduling algorithm to effectively determine which queries to submit and when to submit them. We compare  IconqSched  to other schedulers in terms of end-to-end runtime using realistic workload traces. On Postgres, IconqSched reduces end-to-end runtime by up to 16 . 5% on average and 33 . 6% in the tail. Similarly, on Redshift, it reduces end-to-end runtime by up to 14 . 4% on average and 22 . 9% in the tail.",

    "abstract": "Bu!er management is critical for DBMSs but often suffers from scalability bottlenecks and poor cache locality, which stems from centralized reference counting in page access and intensive locking in page-to-buffer translation. However, prior radical approaches like pointer swizzling or optimistic lock can hardly be adopted in production-grade DBMSs due to its inherent complexity and incompatibility. \nThis paper proposes  ScaleCache , a scalable, highly-efficient and production-grade buffer management system with three key designs. ScaleCache  #rst incorporates a novel compact per-group bu!er reference counting technique, which enables scalable buffer pinning and unpinning by concurrent threads on many-core servers. It then devised a novel read-write lock based on copy-on-write and per-group reference counting, which is suitable for B-link tree. At last, we propose an optimistic, CPU-cache friendly and SIMDaccelerated hash table for fast and scalable page-to-bffer translation, which eliminates most contention on modern many-core hardware. ScaleCache has been adopted in  Huawei GaussDB , a commercial high-performance DBMS. Evaluation on a 128-core server demonstrates that  ScaleCache  exhibits near-linear scalability and can signi#cantly improve index query throughput of both classic B-link tree index and complex graph-based vector index.",

    "abstract": "Modern data-intensive applications generate vast amounts of floating-point data, essential for fields like databases and machine learning. While many compression techniques focus on space efficiency, there is a lack of benchmarks evaluating both compression and query performance, especially in areas like in-situ query execution on compressed data and machine learning tasks such as distance measurement and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) in RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) systems. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating popular lossless floating-point compression methods on three key factors: compression efficiency, database operations performance, and machine learning query performance. We implemented these techniques in Rust and integrated them into an open-source library for use with columnar engines. Our comparison highlights trade-offs between compression efficiency and query performance, showing that no single approach excels in all areas, and some methods trade off compression for slower performance.",

    "abstract": "Data imputation is essential for many data science applications. Existing methods rely heavily on sufficient data redundancy from within-table values. However, many real-world datasets often lack such data redundancy, necessitating external data sources. In this paper, we introduce a retrieval-augmented imputation framework, LakeFill , which combines large language models (LLMs) and data lakes to address this challenge. Unlike existing “table-level” retrieval methods designed for question answering, which retrieve data in the granularity of tables,  LakeFill  performs fine-grained “tuple-level” retrieval, optimized specifically for data imputation at the tuple level. It encodes (possibly incomplete) tuples to capture nuanced similarities and differences, enabling effective identification of candidate tuples. A novel reranking method that integrates checklist-based training data annotation with stratified training group construction further refines the retrieved tuples. Finally, a reasoner with a novel two-stage confidence-aware imputation ensures reliable imputation results. Extensive experiments show that LakeFill  significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for data imputation when there is limited data redundancy.",

    "abstract": "Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in  LLMs  offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying  LLMs  like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose  R-Bot , an  LLM -based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding  LLMs  to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a stepby-step  LLM  rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets and widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system,  R-Bot , surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods. The  R-Bot  system has been deployed at Huawei and with real customers, and the results show that the proposed R-Bot  system achieves lower query latency.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Approach to Integrating Deterministic and Non-deterministic Concurrency Control in Database Systems",
    "abstract": "Deterministic and non-deterministic concurrency control algorith- ms have shown respective advantages under diverse workloads. Thus, a natural idea is to blend them together. However, because deterministic algorithms work with stringent assumptions, e.g., bat- ched execution and non-interactive transactions, they hardly work together with non-deterministic algorithms. To address this issue, we propose HDCC, a hybrid approach that adaptively employs Calvin and OCC, which have distinct concurrency control and log- ging schemes, in the same database system. To ensure serializabil- ity and recovery correctness, we introduce lock-sharing, global val- idation, and two-log-interleaving mechanisms. Additionally, we in- troduce a rule-based assignment mechanism to dynamically select Calvin or OCC based on workload characteristics. Experimental re- sults using TPC-C and YCSB benchmarks demonstrate that HDCC surpasses existing hybrid approaches by up to 3.1×.",

    "title": "FSMDTW: A Fast Index-free Subsequence Matching Algorithm for Dynamic Time Warping",
    "abstract": "The subsequence matching problem utilizing dynamic time warping as the similarity measurement has been recognized as a key operation in time series analysis for more than two decades. Existing index-free algorithms depend on DTW lower bounds to discard the unpromising candidate. However, these approaches typically cost  𝑂 ( 𝑚 )  time for each candidate, where  𝑚 is the length of the query. Consequently, the overhead of computing the DTW lower bounds occupies a significant portion of the time in subsequence matching tasks. This paper proposes new algorithms capable of computing the DTW lower bounds in average  𝑂 ( log 𝑚 )  time for each candidate, substantially alleviating this bottleneck of the subsequence matching problem. In addition, this paper designs novel DTW lower bounds according to the characteristics of the subsequence matching problem, which is more effective without introducing significant computational overhead. Based on the above improvements, an efficient subsequence matching algorithm called FSMDTW is designed. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm is about 2.6 times faster than SOTA on short and medium-length queries and up to one order of magnitude faster on longer queries.",

    "title": "Can Surrogate Keys Negatively Impact Data Quality?",
    "abstract": "Surrogate keys are now extensively utilized by database designers to implement keys in SQL tables. They are straightforward, easy to understand, enable efficient access, and are often considered a sufficient guarantee of data integrity despite lacking any real-world semantic meaning. In spite of all their benefits, one might wonder whether surrogate keys can negatively impact data quality. IT developers who rely exclusively on surrogate keys when designing database schemas may be tempted to not encode natural keys, as they are perceived as complex to manage at the application level. In such settings, surrogate keys allow the presence of so-called  artificial unicity , a complex form of redundancy that can be propagated through foreign keys, and other underlying data-quality issues. In the presence of artificial unicity, most data cleaning techniques, especially unsupervised, are likely to fail, making data preparation and analytics very challenging. \nFor relational databases implemented with surrogate keys but no natural keys, we developed RED2Hunt (RElational Databases REDundancy Hunting), a human-in-the-loop framework for identifying hidden redundancy and, if problems occur, clean the database. The framework was implemented on top of PostgreSQL within an eponym web-based platform to guide the expert through its application. In this paper, we present a demonstration of the RED2Hunt tool through three interactive scenarios on a polluted instance of the publicly available  Perfect Pet  database. During the demonstration, the visitor can take on one of two roles in the Perfect Pet database: a domain expert or a data scientist. As a domain expert, she will interact with RED2Hunt, for example to elicit natural keys, from simple yet very intuitive visualizations of tables’ attributes. As a data scientist, she will explore two simple scenarios—executing SQL queries or applying learning models—on both the initial and cleaned databases to grasp the benefits of the approach.",

    "title": "UNIFY: Unified Index for Range Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThis paper presents an efficient and scalable framework for Range Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (RF-ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors associated with attribute values. Given a query vector  𝑞 and a range  [ 𝑙,ℎ ] , RF-ANNS aims to find the approximate  𝑘 nearest neighbors of  𝑞 among data whose attribute values fall within  [ 𝑙,ℎ ] . Existing methods including pre-, post-, and hybrid filtering strategies that perform attribute range filtering before, after, or during the ANNS process, all suffer from significant performance degradation when query ranges shift. Though building dedicated indexes for each strategy and selecting the best one based on the query range can address this problem, it leads to index consistency and maintenance issues. \nOur framework, called UNIFY, constructs a unified Proximity Graph-based (PG-based) index that seamlessly supports all three strategies. In UNIFY, we introduce SIG, a novel   S egmented   I nclusive G raph, which segments the dataset by attribute values. It ensures the PG of objects from any segment combinations is a sub-graph of SIG, thereby enabling efficient hybrid filtering by reconstructing and searching a PG from relevant segments. Moreover, we present H ierarchical   S egmented   I nclusive   G raph (HSIG), a variant of SIG which incorporates a hierarchical structure inspired by HNSW to achieve logarithmic hybrid filtering complexity. We also implement pre- and post-filtering for HSIG by fusing skip list connections and compressed HNSW edges into the hierarchical graph. Experimental results show that UNIFY delivers state-of-the-art RF-ANNS performance across small, mid, and large query ranges.",
